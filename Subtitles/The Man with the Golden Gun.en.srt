2
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
Nick Nack! Tabasco!

3
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,948
Right away, Monsieur Scaramanga!

4
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,476
Hey.

5
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:28,357
Half. You get the rest later.

6
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,242
Wait for him in there. Through that door.

7
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:43,498
He will join you in a minute.

8
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:16,155
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

9
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,432
"Oh, that would have been too easy."

10
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,977
"It's locked."

11
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:30,523
You'll have to look elsewhere, monsieur.

12
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,944
Hey, Al.

13
00:05:57,194 --> 00:06:02,158
Al, wherever you are,
don't hold it against me.

14
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:13,546
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

15
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:17,967
"Your little golden gun."

16
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:24,557
"Where can it be?"

17
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:30,271
"There is something
we haven't had before."

18
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:35,318
"I wonder what it can be."

19
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:42,742
"I fooled you!"

20
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,707
"You're getting warmer."

21
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,837
"Much warmer."

22
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:22,699
Now, how are you going
to get down the stairs?

23
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:27,579
"So near and yet so far."

24
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,646
"Bravo, Monsieur Scaramanga."

25
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:56,525
You've done it again.

26
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:02,656
- This one was the best, "n'est-ce pas"?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

27
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:05,659
But you'll have to do better
to come into my money.

28
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,955
I'll get you yet,
and I'll enjoy every sou you leave me.

29
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:14,042
You'll be the death of me yet, Nick Nack.

30
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,405
"He has a powerful weapon"

31
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,409
"He charges a million a shot"

32
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,914
"An assassin that's second to none"

33
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,296
"Lurking in some darkened doorway"

34
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:01,925
"Or crouched on a rooftop somewhere"

35
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,345
"In the next room, or this very one"

36
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:10,643
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

37
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:14,230
"Love is required whenever he's hired"

38
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,566
"It comes just before the kill"

39
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,527
"No one can catch him"

40
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,195
"No hit man can match him"

41
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:24,323
"For his million-dollar skill"

42
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:28,202
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

43
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:32,414
"Has come to a glittering end"

44
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:35,292
"For a price, he'll erase anyone"

45
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:39,713
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

46
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:47,638
"His eye may be on you or me"

47
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:52,269
"Who will he bang?"

48
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:00,110
"We shall see"

49
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,241
"Love is required whenever he's hired"

50
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:09,744
"It comes just before the kill"

51
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,371
"No one can catch him"

52
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,206
"No hit man can match him"

53
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:16,376
"For his million-dollar skill"

54
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:20,380
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

55
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,426
"Has come to a glittering end"

56
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,429
"If you want to get rid of someone"

57
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:30,515
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

58
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:33,727
"Will get it done"

59
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:37,230
"He'll shoot anyone"

60
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:46,656
"With his golden gun"

61
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:55,957
Good morning, sir.

62
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Colthorpe.

63
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,837
Chief of Staff.

64
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,716
What do you know
about a man called Scaramanga, 007?

65
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,595
Scaramanga?

66
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,723
Oh, yes! The Man with the Golden Gun.

67
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:15,520
Born in a circus. Father, the ringmaster.
Mother, English. A snake charmer.

68
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:21,359
A spectacular trick-shot artist by the time
he was ten and a local Rio gunman at 15.

69
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:25,196
The KGB trained him in Europe,
where he became

70
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:27,573
an overworked, underpaid assassin.

71
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:30,326
He went independent in the '50s.

72
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:32,829
Current price: One million dollars a hit.

73
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,248
No... er... photograph on file.

74
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:40,378
But he does have one distinguishing
feature, however. A superfluous papilla.

75
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:45,758
- A what?
- A mammary gland. A third nipple, sir.

76
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:49,262
He always uses a golden bullet,
hence "Man with the Golden Gun".

77
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:51,514
Present domicile unknown.

78
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:54,433
I think that's all.

79
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:58,437
Why, sir?

80
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:02,608
Hm! Charming trinket.

81
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,279
- Even has my number on it.
- Precisely.

82
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,323
Obviously it's useless as a bullet.

83
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:11,201
Who would pay a million dollars
to have me killed?

84
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,206
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs,
humiliated tailors. The list is endless.

85
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,460
Moreover, this trinket, as you call it,

86
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:24,132
was sent with a note
requesting "special delivery" to you.

87
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:28,428
- It's initialled with an S.
- Scaramanga's fingerprints were on it.

88
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:31,222
They've been verified by the CIA.

89
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,642
- Why would he alert me?
- Psychological.

90
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:37,896
He counts on his reputation
to terrify his intended victim.

91
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,816
Thank you, gentlemen.

92
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:54,412
I'm relieving you
of your present assignment, 007.

93
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,750
- Er, sir?
- Yes?

94
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:02,295
The energy crisis is still with us.

95
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:07,967
I submit that finding Gibson and his solar
cell data is more important than ever.

96
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,220
It is indeed.

97
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:17,435
And I can't jeopardise it or any mission
by having Scaramanga put a bullet in you.

98
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:21,064
I'll endorse your request to resign.

99
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:24,776
Or you can take a sabbatical
and go to ground until this is settled.

100
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,361
Or until he kills me.

101
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:29,572
Nobody knows where he is
or what he looks like.

102
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:34,286
So I think it's fair to assume
that he has the edge on you.

103
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:38,833
Wouldn't you agree? That's all, 007.

104
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:49,218
If I found him first, sir,

105
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,304
that might change the situation.

106
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:57,560
Dramatically, wouldn't you say?

107
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,980
Good day, Bond.

108
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,613
Moneypenny, Fairbanks.

109
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,992
- Alaska.
- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.

110
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:14,952
Oh, poor Bill.

111
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,705
- I miss him.
- The Man with the Golden Gun didn't.

112
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:20,291
Officially that was never confirmed.

113
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,668
Where was 002 when it happened?

114
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:25,171
Beirut, '69.

115
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,882
In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.

116
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,967
Beirut, hm?

117
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,720
Moneypenny,
you are better than a computer.

118
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,056
In all sorts of ways.

119
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:38,684
But you never take advantage of them.

120
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:42,771
"- Miss Moneypenny.
- Yes, sir."

121
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:46,026
Oh, just one moment, darling.

122
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,611
Yes, James?

123
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,739
Why wasn't Scaramanga
confirmed as the killer?

124
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:55,202
Because they couldn't find the bullet!

125
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:59,122
Darling!

126
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:29,362
Ahmed.

127
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,990
Ahmed!

128
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,408
"Entrez."

129
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:20,414
Good evening.
My name is Bond. James Bond.

130
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:23,500
Your dancing is superb.

131
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,421
"- And so are you.
- Merci."

132
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,759
And you are very handsome.

133
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:39,516
Well, I don't usually intrude like this,
but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.

134
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,936
- Bill Fairbanks.
- Fairbanks?

135
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,730
Yes.

136
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,858
I am told you were with him

137
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,903
when he was rather, er...
rudely interrupted.

138
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,030
Ah, "mais oui" - Bill!

139
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,200
What a terrible night. I will never forget it.

140
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,453
- Did you see who shot him?
- No, I was in his arms.

141
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:03,499
- My eyes were closed.
- At least he died happy.

142
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,752
The bullet went through him.

143
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:11,590
- Through his back and ended up there?
- No, no, through his neck.

144
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,803
I take it out of the wall
before the police arrive.

145
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,806
And now it is my lucky charm.

146
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:20,767
I never dance without it.

147
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:24,896
I'm sure Bill would have loved that.

148
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,067
But let us forget the past.

149
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,570
Mm! I was hoping you'd say that.

150
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,697
Are you staying long in Beirut?

151
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:38,618
Oh, it depends.

152
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:59,473
Clumsy of me.

153
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:12,611
You really do have
a magnificent abdomen.

154
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:25,584
Oh, my perfumes! No!

155
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:41,160
I've lost my charm!

156
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,039
Not from where "I'm" standing.

157
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,213
Taxi? Hotel, mister?

158
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:56,717
No. To the nearest pharmacy.

159
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,388
Dumdum bullets like this

160
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:03,724
flatten on impact
for maximum wounding effect.

161
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,853
- Very nasty.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

162
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:09,522
But just tell me
where it was made and by whom.

163
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:12,608
Well, fortunately it's all in one piece.

164
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,153
20.003 grams.

165
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:18,781
Which leads us to deduce
it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.

166
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:21,909
Colthorpe, there's no such thing
as a 4.2 millimetre gun.

167
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,998
The fact that no recognised munitions
manufacturer, military or civil,

168
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:31,127
produces such a bullet
doesn't mean it doesn't exist, 007.

169
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:35,464
Q Branch have been making irregular
calibres for most unusual purposes.

170
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:41,304
- And we don't put markings on them.
- Making identification almost impossible.

171
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:45,808
You mean we can't trace it? You've
no idea what it went through to get here.

172
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,227
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

173
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:51,815
The workmanship is undemanding
according to our standards.

174
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:56,196
Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.

175
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:59,157
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.

176
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,035
Far East?

177
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,831
- Why not India?
- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.

178
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,793
- Lazar?
- Lazar!

179
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:13,671
Hm. Imaginative.

180
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,840
Highly specialised.

181
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,011
Yes, I concur.

182
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,935
- Well, what the hell is Lazar?
- Not what. Who. Portuguese.

183
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:33,358
- Lives in Macau.
- Chap who made the bullet, 007.

184
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,429
I hate to interrupt your dinner,
but does Senhor Lazar live here?

185
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:08,102
Lazar.

186
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:14,233
I was given this address. Does he...

187
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:18,112
Senhor Lazar?

188
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,906
My name's Bond. James Bond.

189
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:23,868
An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.

190
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:28,539
Your reputation precedes you.
This way, please.

191
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:36,755
It would be my proudest moment if
I could make something for you, Mr Bond.

192
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,716
A rifle, perhaps.

193
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,595
Now, here we have
an interesting problem.

194
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:46,015
A custom-built model for a client

195
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,185
who recently lost two fingers. Please.

196
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,813
- Also lost his trigger.
- It is housed in the butt.

197
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:56,692
Squeeze it.

198
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:08,537
The sights are a bit off.

199
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:13,042
You have five fingers. The butt
is balanced for the pressure of three.

200
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,504
That is why you were one inch too low.

201
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,842
Here you will find only
craftsmanship and quality.

202
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:23,220
Mass production,

203
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:26,515
your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.

204
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,308
What about ammunition?

205
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:32,020
Designed to individual requirements,
whatever they may be.

206
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,731
In gold... if I wanted?

207
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,652
- I have already done that for a client.
- I know you have.

208
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:42,572
Francisco Scaramanga.

209
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:47,703
My relationship with a client, Mr Bond,
is strictly confidential.

210
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:50,081
Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.

211
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:52,750
Oh, of course!

212
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:55,503
Yet you make guns
for fingerless hoodlums,

213
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:57,463
bullets for assassins.

214
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:02,468
Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.
It is the finger that pulls the trigger.

215
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:06,097
Exactly!

216
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:10,476
I'm now aiming precisely at your groin.

217
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,229
So speak or for ever hold your peace.

218
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,022
I have never seen him.

219
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:19,443
On a cost-per-bullet basis,
he must be your best customer.

220
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:23,322
True, but unfortunately
he only fires them occasionally.

221
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:27,285
When was the, er... last shipment?

222
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:31,164
This is impossible. I can't...

223
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,626
You're quite right.

224
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:38,505
An inch too low.

225
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:45,554
I have just completed an order
for immediate delivery.

226
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:48,056
- Who collects them?
- I swear, I do not know.

227
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:53,896
My instructions are to go to the casino.
I am paid and they vanish.

228
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:50,078
"In a few moments we will be
in Hong Kong harbour,"

229
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,372
"one of the busiest ports in the world."

230
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:55,792
"May I remind you to have
passports and landing cards ready,"

231
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,046
"in order to avoid unnecessary delay."

232
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:11,724
"On your left is the wreckage
of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,"

233
00:26:11,975 --> 00:26:16,980
"which sank here under
mysterious circumstances in 1971."

234
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:23,862
"Ahead, you can now see Kowloon,
and on your right, Hong Kong Island."

235
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:47,595
Taxi!

236
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:52,933
Follow that Rolls.

237
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,523
Madam, would you be good enough
to move this inverted bedpan?

238
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:04,279
Sorry I'm late, James, but your signal
from Macau just reached the office.

239
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,531
You're a great help, Goodnight.

240
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:12,120
Now, get on to Licence Bureau
and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.

241
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,122
A green Rolls?

242
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:16,708
A green Rolls-Royce.

243
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,129
There can't be that many in Hong Kong.

244
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,552
Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces
belong to the Peninsula Hotel.

245
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:32,224
You see what a two-year posting
to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?

246
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:35,769
James, it's wonderful to see you.

247
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,899
- Where are you going?
- I need some information.

248
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,492
The subject under surveillance
is in room 602.

249
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,412
I'll buy you dinner, but first
I have official business to attend to.

250
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:57,290
Yes, I saw the "official business".

251
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,794
Goodnight, would I do that to you
after two years?

252
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:04,589
Yes, you bloody well would!

253
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,303
- Please.
- I can manage.

254
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:14,641
You could open a door for me, though.

255
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,858
- I open champagne?
- No, it's a surprise.

256
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,736
Oh! A surprise!

257
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,257
Good afternoon.

258
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:39,854
- A water pistol?
- Pass me that robe.

259
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:51,324
Turn around.

260
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:55,995
Do you always take a shower
with a pistol?

261
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:03,044
Put your hands up and get out of here!

262
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:12,595
- Keep on walking.
- But you haven't answered my question.

263
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:24,649
"Reception. Can I help you?"

264
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:27,986
This is Miss Anders. Room 602.

265
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:30,446
Put those down!

266
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:33,575
I see why these packets carry
a government warning.

267
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,953
Give me that!

268
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:41,291
They certainly can damage your health.

269
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:47,506
- Ow! You're hurting my arm.
- Then tell me where those bullets go.

270
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,926
- No, I can't.
- Try!

271
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:54,847
- He'll kill me!
- Who?

272
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,726
I can't tell you!

273
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:02,396
Scaramanga.

274
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:08,110
You see what you can do when you try?

275
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:12,198
You work for him?

276
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:16,035
I don't work for him.

277
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,662
He's, um... I'm his...

278
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:21,707
Oh. So he's a lover too.

279
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,084
Only before he kills.

280
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:28,214
Bullfighters do the same thing.
Claims it improves the eye.

281
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:31,383
His eye is on me. Where can I find him?

282
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:33,761
I don't know.

283
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,554
I don't know.

284
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:36,889
I said where?!

285
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,350
I don't know!
He doesn't tell me everything.

286
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:43,312
I know he has a date
at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.

287
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:45,606
How will I recognise him?

288
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,859
- Tall, slim and dark.
- So is my aunt.

289
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:53,113
- Anything distinctive about him?
- Yes, but how can I...

290
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:55,783
He is not like other people. He has three...

291
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,535
Oh.

292
00:31:57,744 --> 00:32:03,166
Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most
useless piece of information I ever heard.

293
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:09,714
Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club
and Scaramanga is performing there.

294
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:13,426
You'll have to do better.

295
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:17,848
He usually wears
a white linen suit, black tie,

296
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:21,184
and jewellery, all gold.

297
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:23,186
You're improving.

298
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:27,524
I don't want you to twist my arm again.

299
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,609
I don't want to either.

300
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,445
So I'll tell you what you're going to do.

301
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:36,284
You're going to take the bullets
to Mr Scaramanga,

302
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:41,956
because, if he doesn't get them,
he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.

303
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:45,126
And I want him there.

304
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:48,546
- Why should you trust me?
- I don't.

305
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:54,051
But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he
hears about this interesting conversation.

306
00:32:54,302 --> 00:33:00,057
Who knows? He may even use
one of those little golden bullets on you.

307
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:02,393
And that would be a pity,

308
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:06,522
because they're "very" expensive.

309
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:09,442
I'll take them to him.

310
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:13,322
Let's drink to that.

311
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:18,952
Bottoms up!

312
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,923
- Soda or ginger ale?
- Ginger ale, please.

313
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,571
Police! Drop it!

314
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,949
Drop it!

315
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,828
You're under arrest.

316
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,002
Move away from there!

317
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,343
If you take the trouble to examine
that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.

318
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:23,515
Anything you have to say,
you can say at the station.

319
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:32,858
I'm charging him under Section 473.

320
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:49,374
- I didn't see your identity card.
- You will.

321
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,225
Here.

322
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:11,606
- I thought we were going to the station.
- Kowloon side.

323
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:54,335
Kowloon's over there!

324
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:59,132
We're going to the New Territories!

325
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,597
"Welcome aboard, Commander Bond."

326
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:52,061
"This way, sir."

327
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:58,567
"Down the hatchway, please."

328
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:05,241
Good evening, sir.

329
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:09,119
Would you follow me, please?

330
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,627
It certainly gives you a new slant.

331
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:20,256
What with the Chinese on one side
and the US fleet on the other,

332
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:24,343
down here's the only place
in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.

333
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:29,765
And with current real-estate prices
in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?

334
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:33,644
A Chinese fighter we salvaged.

335
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:42,612
Good evening, 007.

336
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,616
Glad to see you're still with us.

337
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:56,668
In future, Commander Bond, if you must
tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,

338
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,130
- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.
- Sorry, Commander.

339
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,427
I had to get you away from the police,
but didn't know how much you knew.

340
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:06,970
Nothing.

341
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,766
But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga
does not have a contract on me.

342
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:16,188
He couldn't have missed me tonight.
Instead he hit a chap at a club.

343
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:21,693
- I got a shock when I saw who it was.
- I should think you did.

344
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,989
Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.

345
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:29,911
Yes. Gibson. He was prepared
to come back under certain conditions.

346
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,538
That's why I'm here
with Professor Frazier.

347
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:36,375
Lieutenant Hip
was making a preliminary contact.

348
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:42,048
I almost wish that Scaramanga
had a contract on you.

349
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:43,799
Was Gibson cooperative?

350
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,555
He wanted to bargain for immunity.
Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.

351
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:52,309
- Why Bangkok?
- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.

352
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:54,061
That name's come up before.

353
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,231
A multimillionaire.
Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.

354
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,441
All legitimate, as far as we know.

355
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,361
What did Gibson
propose bargaining with?

356
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:05,614
A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.

357
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:09,827
If he developed a solar cell that efficient,
he solved the energy crisis.

358
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:11,787
So you've told me.

359
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,499
Coal and oil will soon be depleted.
Uranium's too dangerous.

360
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:19,378
Geothermal and tidal control
too expensive. I know all that.

361
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:22,881
- Where's the solex now?
- Solex "agitator", sir.

362
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:27,052
"The" essential unit to convert
radiation from the sun into electricity

363
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,013
on an industrial basis. It's only that size.

364
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:34,476
It won't take long to check out Gibson's
efficiency claim. This is exciting!

365
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,563
May I see it, Lieutenant?

366
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:41,900
He showed it to me at the bar
and replaced it in his pocket.

367
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,903
And after he was shot,

368
00:42:45,153 --> 00:42:47,656
it wasn't there.

369
00:42:47,906 --> 00:42:50,701
I looked.

370
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,120
Gentlemen, I congratulate you.

371
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,998
Instead of getting a perfected solex,

372
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:59,459
we're left with a useless corpse
and no leads.

373
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:02,213
One lead, sir.

374
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:05,592
Assuming Gibson
was killed by Scaramanga,

375
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:08,845
whoever hired him
could afford a million dollars.

376
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:12,432
- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?
- He could afford it.

377
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,726
Out of petty cash.

378
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:17,145
A thought has occurred to me.

379
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,231
If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,

380
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,735
- it's unlikely that he met him personally.
- Why?

381
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:27,614
If anything had gone wrong,
there's nothing to connect the two.

382
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:30,742
That gives me an idea
as to how to approach him.

383
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:35,705
Q, I'll... need this.

384
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:41,211
- Really, 007!
- Oh, I admit it's a little kinky.

385
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:45,131
You'll take Miss Goodnight with you.

386
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,134
- Goodnight, sir?
- After tonight's debacle,

387
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:53,556
an efficient liaison officer
wouldn't come amiss.

388
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,600
Thank you, sir.

389
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:57,560
You won't get near Hai Fat.

390
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,855
I have relatives in Bangkok.
I have often passed his place.

391
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:05,735
He lives in a house on a mountain
surrounded by guards.

392
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:51,616
No way!
The place is crawling with guards.

393
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:55,495
Have a look.

394
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,460
Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.

395
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:06,131
I'm sure he'll see me.

396
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:31,741
Good morning. How's the water?

397
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:33,910
Why don't you come in and find out?

398
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:37,914
- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...
- Chew Mee.

399
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,041
Really?

400
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,586
There's only one problem.
I have no swimming trunks.

401
00:45:43,878 --> 00:45:46,714
Neither have I.

402
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:50,384
What are you doing here?

403
00:45:51,928 --> 00:45:55,431
Get out!

404
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:57,016
Immediately.

405
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,520
I will have you...

406
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,573
Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.

407
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:16,661
Excuse me, Chew Mee.

408
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:20,289
Bye-ee.

409
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:23,709
You understand my surprise.

410
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:27,588
I thought it was understood.

411
00:46:27,964 --> 00:46:30,967
We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.

412
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:33,511
I always thought
your abnormality was a myth.

413
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:38,307
Some cults consider it a sign of
invulnerability and great sexual prowess.

414
00:46:38,516 --> 00:46:41,143
I've learned to live with it.

415
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:43,312
Why are you here?

416
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:45,274
Bond. James Bond.

417
00:46:45,524 --> 00:46:48,735
- Do I know the gentleman?
- Well, he knows you.

418
00:46:49,027 --> 00:46:53,240
Without being immodest, there are few
people in this part of the world who don't.

419
00:46:53,448 --> 00:46:56,535
And there are very few people
who haven't heard of Bond.

420
00:46:56,785 --> 00:47:00,289
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.

421
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:03,375
He's good, even by my standards.

422
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,879
- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.
- A coincidence.

423
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:09,173
I don't believe in them.

424
00:47:09,464 --> 00:47:11,800
The man's a menace.
He knows something.

425
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,805
Are you suggesting I invest
another million to remove him?

426
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:17,849
That's up to you.

427
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,185
I will give it some thought.

428
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:25,190
Since you have chosen to meet me,
perhaps you will dine here tonight.

429
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,318
- I'll be delighted.
- Nine o'clock, then.

430
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:33,990
Ling Po, see this gentleman out.

431
00:47:45,752 --> 00:47:47,712
Don't tell me you saw him?!

432
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:50,131
He even invited me to dinner.

433
00:47:50,423 --> 00:47:54,594
He must have found me quite titillating.

434
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:16,367
In due time, I shall be laid to rest
here in my mausoleum

435
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:19,411
after a useful, happy, long life.

436
00:48:19,703 --> 00:48:25,334
And I do not intend
to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.

437
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:33,425
I'll get the car.

438
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:38,389
- You know I'd rather be dining with you.
- I understand, James. Please hurry back.

439
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,059
I'll ring as soon as I do.
A midnight snack might be just the thing.

440
00:48:42,268 --> 00:48:44,895
I'll keep the wine properly chilled.

441
00:48:45,145 --> 00:48:48,941
And everything else warm, I trust.

442
00:48:55,322 --> 00:48:56,991
Bye-bye!

443
00:48:57,283 --> 00:49:00,870
And everything else warm?!

444
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:04,832
I hope you don't mind
giving my nieces a lift.

445
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:08,252
Good evening.

446
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:17,721
Hai Fat's is on the way.

447
00:49:23,018 --> 00:49:26,897
I'll drop the girls, come back and wait.

448
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:30,901
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

449
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:44,456
The name's Scaramanga.
Mr Fat is expecting me.

450
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:09,022
Grislyland.

451
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:35,509
A pleasant evening.

452
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:26,059
Get him! Come on!

453
00:51:34,985 --> 00:51:38,655
Stop it!

454
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,951
Not here.

455
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:45,205
This is my home.

456
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:49,209
Take Mr Bond to school.

457
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:06,142
Heaven.

458
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,606
Definitely heaven.

459
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:10,353
Tashman.

460
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:35,939
Chula.

461
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:41,987
Chula! Chula! Chula!

462
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:06,971
Chula! Chula! Chula!

463
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:56,522
Are you all right?

464
00:56:56,772 --> 00:57:01,277
- How did you find me?
- Hai Fat owns this place.

465
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:11,453
Stand back, girls.

466
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,218
Forgot to tell you!

467
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:31,140
Their father runs a karate school.

468
00:58:29,366 --> 00:58:32,369
Hang on!

469
00:58:57,603 --> 00:59:02,067
What you might call
a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!

470
00:59:37,936 --> 00:59:40,063
Pretty lady, 100 bahts.

471
00:59:40,314 --> 00:59:42,107
- No, no.
- 80 bahts.

472
00:59:42,357 --> 00:59:43,442
50 bahts.

473
00:59:43,692 --> 00:59:47,738
Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.

474
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:51,617
Missy, yesa!

475
01:00:01,543 --> 01:00:05,631
Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.

476
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:13,430
Elephant! Real elephant.

477
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,601
50 bahts.

478
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:22,607
You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.

479
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,943
For you, mister, 20 bahts.

480
01:00:25,193 --> 01:00:31,032
Sonny, I'll give you 20,000 bahts
if you can make this heap go any faster.

481
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:34,577
20,000 bahts!

482
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:42,585
- I'm afraid I'll have to owe you.
- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!

483
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:01,521
Goddamn little brown water hog!

484
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:04,023
Oh, what's the matter, JW, huh?

485
01:01:04,232 --> 01:01:10,822
You just try that in "my" bayou, boy!
I'd haul your ass!

486
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:33,971
Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me
one of those cute little elephants.

487
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:36,056
Elephants!

488
01:01:36,307 --> 01:01:39,894
We're Democrats, Maybelle.

489
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,775
If you got your little pointy heads
out of them pajamas,

490
01:01:46,984 --> 01:01:50,654
you wouldn't be late for work.

491
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,352
I knew it!

492
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:28,485
You pointy-heads has no more idea
of traffic control than a gooney bird!

493
01:02:35,116 --> 01:02:40,830
Get your cotton-picking schnoz
out of my pants. Hear now?

494
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:04,772
Boy, you is ugly.

495
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:09,610
JW?

496
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:13,239
Where are you?

497
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:46,063
What do they teach in that school?
Ballet dancing?

498
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:51,652
I find nothing remotely amusing
about Mr Bond's escape.

499
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,404
You underestimated him.

500
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:57,659
Even my influence doesn't extend
into the British Secret Service.

501
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,661
I shall lie low too.

502
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:03,624
I won't jeopardise a project
in which I've invested half my fortune,

503
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,792
when it's ready to yield billions.

504
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:10,047
- Where will you hide out?
- That does not concern you.

505
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:12,758
Take this.

506
01:04:13,008 --> 01:04:17,930
Return it to the plant and
don't leave there without my permission.

507
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,307
May I remind you that you work for me.

508
01:04:20,516 --> 01:04:25,145
I took you on as a junior partner to be an
occasional convenience. Nothing more.

509
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:28,899
I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.

510
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:34,321
- Is that clearly understood?
- Oh, yes, very clearly.

511
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:39,034
I now regret having even considered
employing your services,

512
01:04:39,326 --> 01:04:41,328
but that is beside the point.

513
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:46,083
Bond doesn't know you're in Bangkok.
He's never seen you, but he knows me.

514
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,461
That's the problem.

515
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:52,298
That's no problem.

516
01:05:10,483 --> 01:05:13,612
What happened?

517
01:05:13,904 --> 01:05:16,198
Mr Fat has just resigned.

518
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:20,244
I'm the new chairman of the board.

519
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:22,872
He always did like that mausoleum.

520
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:26,709
Put him in it.

521
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:45,811
Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.

522
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:50,691
Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry
gets a polite Oriental brushoff.

523
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,485
With the compliments.

524
01:05:53,736 --> 01:05:56,155
"Phuyuck"?

525
01:05:56,405 --> 01:06:00,034
'74, sir.

526
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:07,082
- I approve.
- You do?

527
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:10,753
Oh, not the wine. Your frock.

528
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:14,507
Tight in all the right places.
Not too many buttons.

529
01:06:14,757 --> 01:06:17,468
Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.

530
01:06:17,718 --> 01:06:20,429
The buttons are down the back.

531
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:24,684
Designed by Q, no doubt.
One of them's a suicide pill, I suppose.

532
01:06:24,935 --> 01:06:29,147
No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.

533
01:06:29,397 --> 01:06:31,358
How original.

534
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:37,948
"A toast.
Per ora e per il momento che verrá."

535
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:40,534
"To this moment,

536
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:44,371
and the moment yet to come."

537
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:52,963
In our profession, I'm afraid, you never
can count on that moment to come.

538
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:57,175
Who knows where you and I will be
this time next year?

539
01:06:57,425 --> 01:07:00,595
Opposite sides of the world, most likely.

540
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:03,348
That's too far apart.

541
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:06,852
Now, if Hip doesn't come up with a lead,

542
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,731
there's really nothing very much
for us to do tonight.

543
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:17,404
Or is there?

544
01:07:17,654 --> 01:07:20,949
Oh, darling, I'm tempted.

545
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,536
But killing a few hours
as one of your passing fancies

546
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:28,456
isn't quite my scene.

547
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:09,499
Phuyuck!

548
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:23,722
Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.

549
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:27,809
My hard-to-get act
didn't last very long, did it?

550
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:32,022
I was trained
to expect the unexpected, but...

551
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:37,653
they never prepared me
for anything like you in a nightie.

552
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,839
James, I thought
this would never happen.

553
01:09:02,595 --> 01:09:07,308
- What made you change your mind?
- I'm weak.

554
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:12,105
Don't move!

555
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:31,916
Miss Anders! I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.

556
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,460
I bribed a bellboy to let me in.

557
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:36,588
I've come to warn you,

558
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:38,756
you're in great danger.

559
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:44,262
I usually am. That's why I use
the old three-pillow trick.

560
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:47,891
Please believe me.
I'm risking my life to come here.

561
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:51,477
Well, your concern for my wellbeing
is touching,

562
01:09:51,728 --> 01:09:53,813
but puzzles me.

563
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:57,775
- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.
- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.

564
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:01,738
We've been through that routine.

565
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:05,241
He's a monster. I hate him.

566
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:07,828
Then leave him.

567
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:11,165
You don't walk out on Scaramanga.

568
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:16,754
- There's no place he wouldn't find me.
- You need a good lawyer.

569
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,881
I need 007.

570
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:23,677
Who do you think sent that bullet
to London with your number on it?

571
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:27,556
I did.

572
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:33,854
And it wasn't easy
getting his fingerprint on the note.

573
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,942
Forgive me
if I've been slow on the uptake.

574
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:42,322
Don't you see you're the only man
in the world who can kill him?

575
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:45,283
Now, what gives you that idea?

576
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:48,453
The way Scaramanga speaks about you.

577
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:53,458
- Even has a likeness of you.
- I'm flattered.

578
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:58,588
I want him dead.

579
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:03,552
Name your price. Anything, I'll pay it.

580
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:09,432
You can have me too, if you like.

581
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,685
I'm not unattractive.

582
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:16,731
At last you're starting to tell the truth.

583
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:23,573
I've dreamed about you setting me free.

584
01:11:27,702 --> 01:11:34,000
I've been dreaming about a solex agitator.

585
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:41,674
Ever heard of one?

586
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:47,638
Perhaps you can have that too.

587
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:05,865
- No, my clothes are in there.
- Get in.

588
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:09,744
- I'll kill that woman.
- Later!

589
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:30,848
Charming.

590
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:51,828
It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.

591
01:13:32,452 --> 01:13:34,621
You're late.

592
01:13:34,913 --> 01:13:38,501
It was a double feature.

593
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:42,463
What are you doing?

594
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:46,509
Putting my jewellery away.

595
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:03,027
You can come out now.

596
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:05,946
- What time is it?
- Two-ish.

597
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:09,658
Two? You mean
I've been in here for two hours?

598
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:12,119
All in the line of duty.

599
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:15,164
Duty! I'm resigning in the morning!

600
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:18,834
Goodnight, don't let us down.
The Service needs women like you.

601
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:22,922
Well, obviously you don't!

602
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,549
Forgive me, darling.

603
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:27,968
Your turn will come, I promise.

604
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:30,262
As soon as she brings me that solex.

605
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:35,518
- For killing Scaramanga?
- If she gets me the solex agitator first.

606
01:14:35,768 --> 01:14:37,645
First?

607
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:42,191
James, you must be good.

608
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:49,323
Oh. We'll find out about that
the next time I meet her.

609
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:53,577
She's making the arrangements.

610
01:15:32,701 --> 01:15:36,246
Sorry I'm late.
Bangkok traffic's worse than Piccadilly.

611
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:38,707
He's made contact.

612
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:42,544
- How's the charm boy doing?
- Need you ask?

613
01:15:42,794 --> 01:15:46,047
Meet you outside.

614
01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:51,803
Did you bring it?

615
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:21,250
Darling, I left it in your handbag.

616
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,338
It must be in here somewhere, dear.
I saw the man in the shop give it to you.

617
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:28,257
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt.

618
01:16:28,466 --> 01:16:31,678
You won't find it in there, Mr Bond.
I looked before you came.

619
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:36,308
I wouldn't do that either. Look behind you.

620
01:16:36,475 --> 01:16:39,686
Lower.

621
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:46,151
A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.
What will they think of next?

622
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:51,031
My name is Scaramanga.
Francisco Scaramanga.

623
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:55,244
I feel I know you, although
I never thought we should ever meet.

624
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:59,665
It's a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond,
thanks to Miss Anders.

625
01:16:59,873 --> 01:17:02,376
You've a strange way
of showing gratitude.

626
01:17:02,668 --> 01:17:06,004
A mistress cannot serve two masters.

627
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:09,299
A difficult shot, but most gratifying.

628
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:13,053
Well, we, er... all get our jollies
one way or another.

629
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:16,014
Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.

630
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:19,309
When I was a boy
I was brought up in a circus.

631
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,481
My only real friend
was a magnificent African bull elephant.

632
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:29,779
One day his handler mistreated him
and he went berserk.

633
01:17:30,154 --> 01:17:33,324
Bleeding, dying,

634
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:37,245
he came and found me.

635
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:44,419
Stood on one leg - his best trick -
picked me up and put me on his back.

636
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:50,133
The man emptied the gun into his eye.

637
01:17:50,675 --> 01:17:57,348
- I emptied my stage pistol into his.
- An eye for an eye. Nut?

638
01:18:01,227 --> 01:18:04,439
You see, Mr Bond,
I always thought I liked animals.

639
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:09,652
Then I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.

640
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:19,287
Keep this. Whatever you do, don't lose it.

641
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:22,665
- I have to help James.
- Something's wrong?

642
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,752
- There's a midget with a gun on him.
- A midget?

643
01:18:26,044 --> 01:18:31,132
Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.
The girl is dead. Call the police!

644
01:18:37,305 --> 01:18:39,516
Forget the girl. She's replaceable.

645
01:18:39,766 --> 01:18:42,018
And I shall find what she stole from me.

646
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:46,815
Personally, I have nothing against you,
so let's hope our paths never cross again.

647
01:18:47,066 --> 01:18:48,984
Please don't try to follow me.

648
01:18:49,235 --> 01:18:52,196
Your peanut-toting friend back there
wouldn't like it.

649
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:56,075
No, he wouldn't.

650
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:09,547
You want to try one of mine?

651
01:19:18,472 --> 01:19:20,599
- Where's the solex?
- With Goodnight.

652
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:24,186
- Where's Goodnight?
- Outside.

653
01:19:58,014 --> 01:20:01,642
She must be by the car.

654
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:32,340
Women! Walkie-talkie.

655
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:38,429
- Goodnight, where are you?
- Somebody locked me in a boot.

656
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:43,851
"- In a what?!
- The midget's car. I'm locked in."

657
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:50,316
"It's a bronze car with a black roof.
Number 7543."

658
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,447
- The keys!
- I haven't got them.

659
01:20:56,656 --> 01:20:58,824
Oh, no.

660
01:20:59,075 --> 01:21:02,662
"- Goodnight, where are the car keys?
- Oh, I've got the keys."

661
01:21:02,954 --> 01:21:07,083
And I've got the solex too.

662
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:09,210
Taxi!

663
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:14,174
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.

664
01:21:20,847 --> 01:21:24,476
Taxi! Taxi!

665
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:28,438
Taxi!

666
01:21:37,322 --> 01:21:42,244
- How 'bout a demonstration, boy?
- Certainly, sir.

667
01:21:49,001 --> 01:21:53,463
What the hell is goin' on?!

668
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:01,013
Now... I know you!

669
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:02,556
Oh, no.

670
01:22:02,764 --> 01:22:08,812
You're that secret agent.
That English secret agent from England.

671
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:20,699
You're chasin' somebody.

672
01:22:20,908 --> 01:22:23,578
Who are you after this time, boy?
Commies?

673
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:28,250
Let's go get 'em! I'm with you all the way.

674
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:38,886
Uh-oh. I think we've got trouble.

675
01:22:56,070 --> 01:23:00,115
Pull your cars over,
you little brown pointy-heads!

676
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:03,285
I'm a peace officer!

677
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:06,038
"James? Are you still there?"

678
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:07,998
"James!"

679
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:10,459
Can you hear me? James!

680
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:12,628
All right, Goodnight. Don't panic.

681
01:23:12,836 --> 01:23:15,881
- Who's that?
- It's, er...

682
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:18,551
- It's Headquarters.
- Let me talk to 'em.

683
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:20,928
Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,

684
01:23:21,136 --> 01:23:22,680
"Louisiana State Police."

685
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:28,310
"You call my wife at the Narai Hotel
and tell her I'm on a mission."

686
01:23:28,602 --> 01:23:31,063
I've been deputised. Right?

687
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:32,815
Right.

688
01:23:33,065 --> 01:23:36,694
Which car are we all chasin', boy?

689
01:24:46,556 --> 01:24:49,351
Move it! Move it!

690
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:53,356
Get that piece of junk off of the road.

691
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:23,887
They went left, boy.

692
01:25:31,311 --> 01:25:35,190
Press that pedal, boy.

693
01:25:48,579 --> 01:25:52,249
Where the hell have they got to?

694
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:08,224
You goofed, boy.

695
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:23,323
Nearest bridge is two miles back.

696
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:33,416
Goddamn! What the...

697
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:38,880
What's goin' on?
What the hell are you doin' now, boy?

698
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:43,051
The bridge is "that" way!

699
01:26:45,637 --> 01:26:47,347
You're not thinking of...?

700
01:26:47,597 --> 01:26:50,767
I sure am, boy!

701
01:26:51,017 --> 01:26:54,854
Ever heard of Evel Knievel?

702
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:07,492
Wowee!

703
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:10,453
I ain't never done that before!

704
01:27:10,662 --> 01:27:14,541
Neither have I, actually.

705
01:28:09,263 --> 01:28:13,517
Let's go get 'em, boy!

706
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:50,014
You stay put, boy.

707
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:53,684
This is "my" department.

708
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,021
Glad to see you boys on the ball!

709
01:28:57,271 --> 01:29:00,441
Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.

710
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,485
Here's my identification.

711
01:29:02,693 --> 01:29:05,571
Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.

712
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:08,950
Me and my partner here,
we're on a secret mission.

713
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,663
What the hell you doing?
Give me my wallet back.

714
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:35,977
Doors.

715
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:07,759
You can't do this to me.
I want my wallet back.

716
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,053
Take these goddamn bracelets off!

717
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,433
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest!
Police brutality. I got connections.

718
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:17,936
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass!
The CIA!

719
01:30:18,186 --> 01:30:21,690
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna get Henry Kissinger!

720
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:26,820
Now look at me
when I'm talkin' to ya, boy.

721
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:36,496
What's the matter?
Ain't none of you seen a plane before?

722
01:30:38,207 --> 01:30:41,710
"James? James, are you still there?"

723
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,879
"Can you hear me?"

724
01:30:44,087 --> 01:30:47,758
"I think we've stopped."

725
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:10,616
That is really
all there is to report, sir.

726
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:13,786
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.

727
01:31:14,078 --> 01:31:15,371
Yes, sir.

728
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:19,291
- In a car that sprouted wings.
- That's perfectly feasible, sir.

729
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,212
- In fact, we're working on one now.
- Oh, Q! Shut up.

730
01:31:23,462 --> 01:31:25,798
- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?
- Yes, sir.

731
01:31:26,048 --> 01:31:29,927
We found the car-plane abandoned
about 200 miles west of Bangkok.

732
01:31:30,219 --> 01:31:33,472
- And the solex?
- In Goodnight's handbag, sir.

733
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:36,141
- Where's Goodnight now?
- We don't know, sir.

734
01:31:36,433 --> 01:31:40,563
Communications aren't getting the signal
from the homer she has supplied by Q.

735
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:44,817
Rubbish! They're simply
not stepping up the reception to enable...

736
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:46,986
Oh, shut up, Q!

737
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:51,115
Of all the fouled-up,
half-witted operations!

738
01:31:51,323 --> 01:31:54,702
- What do you want?
- We've picked up Goodnight's signal, sir.

739
01:31:54,952 --> 01:32:00,416
- Well, that's something.
- But there's something rather curious, sir.

740
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,376
Our sector's here,

741
01:32:02,585 --> 01:32:07,423
and we're receiving her signal
from somewhere off this coastline here.

742
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:10,843
Now here it is on a much larger scale.

743
01:32:11,093 --> 01:32:14,430
That's where she is.
In this group of small islands.

744
01:32:14,638 --> 01:32:17,309
That's all we need! Red Chinese waters.

745
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:20,562
We could stray
inadvertently into them, sir.

746
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:25,275
- I could fly low under their radar screen.
- Absolutely out of the question.

747
01:32:25,525 --> 01:32:29,613
If the PM gets to hear of this,
he'll hang me from the yardarm.

748
01:32:29,863 --> 01:32:35,285
Officially you won't know
a thing about it, sir.

749
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:53,865
There's a small seaplane
approaching your island.

750
01:33:54,115 --> 01:33:56,033
Do you want us to take action?

751
01:33:56,284 --> 01:34:00,955
No. No, please don't do anything.

752
01:34:01,497 --> 01:34:03,040
Yes, it's a...

753
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:06,920
guest I'm expecting.

754
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:10,799
No, he won't be leaving.

755
01:35:28,795 --> 01:35:31,214
"Bonjour, Monsieur Bond."

756
01:35:31,506 --> 01:35:34,467
I am Nick Nack.

757
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,805
"Dom Pérignon soixante-quatre."

758
01:35:39,013 --> 01:35:41,224
I prefer the '62 myself.

759
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:43,393
Still, beats a bag of peanuts.

760
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:48,856
Monsieur Scaramanga
will welcome you personally.

761
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:57,074
Forgive me, Mr Bond.
A vulgar display, but I couldn't resist it

762
01:35:57,283 --> 01:36:00,661
because I am so delighted
to see you again.

763
01:36:00,911 --> 01:36:03,831
A harmless toy.

764
01:36:04,123 --> 01:36:07,835
I am, as you can see now,
completely unarmed.

765
01:36:08,127 --> 01:36:09,795
Cigarette?

766
01:36:10,045 --> 01:36:12,840
We have so much in common
and so much to discuss.

767
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:15,259
We will never have this chance again.

768
01:36:15,509 --> 01:36:20,389
Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us
spend a few pleasant hours together.

769
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,225
How can I refuse
such a gracious invitation?

770
01:36:23,517 --> 01:36:25,686
Splendid. Splendid!

771
01:36:25,895 --> 01:36:30,399
Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass
yourself. He's a cordon bleu, you know?

772
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:34,570
By the way, where's Miss Goodnight?

773
01:36:34,862 --> 01:36:36,947
Oh, she's around here somewhere.

774
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:39,950
She can't leave,
so she does as she pleases.

775
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:42,203
How do you like my island?

776
01:36:42,453 --> 01:36:44,163
A bit off the beaten track.

777
01:36:44,413 --> 01:36:47,708
It's rent-free.
I do my landlords an occasional favour.

778
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,085
A cosy arrangement.

779
01:36:50,294 --> 01:36:53,130
- Servant problem, I suppose?
- Not at all.

780
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:57,134
Nick Nack does for me very nicely.

781
01:36:58,093 --> 01:37:01,389
Usually there's just us two,
but guests are no inconvenience.

782
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:06,603
We're entirely self-supporting. We have
every electrical device you can think of.

783
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:11,734
This is an airlock,
as you are doubtless aware.

784
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:15,863
Automatic, of course.

785
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:21,077
Naturally, we have an ample supply
of electricity here.

786
01:37:21,327 --> 01:37:24,956
Let me show you.

787
01:37:39,011 --> 01:37:41,514
This should run
a few electric toothbrushes.

788
01:37:41,806 --> 01:37:45,434
Up here.

789
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:52,400
A solar-energy station.
So this is what it's all about. Ah!

790
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:57,488
Thermoelectric generators
to convert solar energy into electricity.

791
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,575
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company, no doubt.

792
01:38:00,825 --> 01:38:05,413
Somehow I seem to have inherited it
from him. It's all fully automated.

793
01:38:05,663 --> 01:38:10,668
Kra looks after maintenance and security
in here. Nick Nack does everything else.

794
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:14,755
They tell me the electricity
is stored in here... somewhere.

795
01:38:15,006 --> 01:38:18,384
Science was never my strong point.

796
01:38:18,634 --> 01:38:23,389
Superconductivity coils
cooled by liquid helium.

797
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:28,937
If I were you, I wouldn't stick my finger -
or anything else, for that matter - in there.

798
01:38:29,187 --> 01:38:33,984
At 453% below zero, that liquid helium
would break it off like an icicle.

799
01:38:34,234 --> 01:38:36,862
You really know
far more about it than I do.

800
01:38:37,112 --> 01:38:41,783
I'm arranging for countries that can afford
the price to send experts here to see this.

801
01:38:42,034 --> 01:38:45,245
But no solex
until the money is in the bank, right?

802
01:38:45,495 --> 01:38:46,830
Right.

803
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:51,376
- I have run across similar situations.
- Not what I've got here.

804
01:38:51,627 --> 01:38:55,088
This way the highest bidder
can build hundreds of stations

805
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:58,634
and sell franchises for hundreds more.

806
01:38:58,884 --> 01:39:02,054
He will literally have the sun in his pocket.

807
01:39:02,304 --> 01:39:05,265
A monopoly on solar power.

808
01:39:05,474 --> 01:39:09,186
The oil sheikhs will pay you
just to keep solar energy "off" the market.

809
01:39:09,436 --> 01:39:13,482
The thought had occurred to me.

810
01:39:16,485 --> 01:39:20,280
This is the collection point.

811
01:39:32,334 --> 01:39:35,379
Ah! So that's where it belongs.

812
01:39:35,629 --> 01:39:42,554
Our famous solex in the still down there
transmits heat to the thermal generators.

813
01:39:43,304 --> 01:39:46,933
It's collected through this?

814
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:53,982
But where is it collected from?
You need the sun.

815
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:06,036
Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.

816
01:40:26,932 --> 01:40:28,267
Ingenious, isn't it?

817
01:40:28,517 --> 01:40:31,729
The panels lock on to the sun,
then track it automatically.

818
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:35,274
Something like that, yes.

819
01:40:41,363 --> 01:40:47,119
Ah. Reflected through this, those panels
must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.

820
01:40:47,369 --> 01:40:51,415
If you say so, Mr Bond.

821
01:40:53,043 --> 01:40:59,216
But I do know we can focus the power
wherever we want. Here, I'll show you.

822
01:41:00,133 --> 01:41:03,929
This is a bonus.

823
01:41:04,429 --> 01:41:08,350
Goes with the solex. No extra charge.

824
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:32,165
This is the part I really like.

825
01:41:40,507 --> 01:41:44,511
Now that's what I call solar power.

826
01:41:44,803 --> 01:41:48,431
That's what I call trouble.

827
01:41:48,723 --> 01:41:54,646
You must admit I am now undeniably
the Man with the Golden Gun.

828
01:41:59,192 --> 01:42:02,862
Lunch.

829
01:42:17,795 --> 01:42:20,965
This way, Mr Bond.

830
01:42:21,215 --> 01:42:23,426
Ah, Miss Goodnight!

831
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:26,679
- James!
- Aren't we a little overdressed?

832
01:42:26,971 --> 01:42:30,099
I like a girl in a bikini.
No concealed weapons.

833
01:42:30,349 --> 01:42:34,604
Miss Goodnight, please. Mr Bond.

834
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:37,440
Let's see what Nick Nack has for us.

835
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:41,319
Ah, mushrooms.

836
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:46,157
The fried mushroom
looks terribly interesting.

837
01:42:46,449 --> 01:42:51,537
Yes, I'd noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.

838
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,877
- Having fun in the sun, Goodnight?
- Yes!

839
01:42:57,085 --> 01:43:00,756
I could stay here for ever.

840
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,884
Mm, excellent.

841
01:43:04,134 --> 01:43:10,474
- Slightly reminiscent of a '34 Mouton.
- Then I must add it to my cellar.

842
01:43:11,183 --> 01:43:14,019
You live well, Scaramanga.

843
01:43:14,269 --> 01:43:18,190
At a million dollars a contract,
I can afford to, Mr Bond.

844
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:23,738
You work for peanuts. A "well done" from
the Queen and a pittance of a pension.

845
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:27,283
Apart from that, we are the same.

846
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:32,664
To us, Mr Bond. We are the best.

847
01:43:32,997 --> 01:43:38,461
There's a useful four-letter word,
and you're full of it.

848
01:43:39,587 --> 01:43:42,840
When I kill it's under specific orders
of my government.

849
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,843
And those I kill are themselves killers.

850
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:48,596
Come, come, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

851
01:43:48,846 --> 01:43:51,975
You get as much fulfilment
out of killing as I do. Admit it.

852
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:56,688
- I admit killing you would be a pleasure.
- You should have done that before.

853
01:43:56,938 --> 01:44:01,025
But then the English don't think
it's sporting to kill in cold blood.

854
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:04,696
Don't count on that.

855
01:44:14,497 --> 01:44:20,128
I could have shot you when you landed,
but that would have been too easy.

856
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:24,883
You see, Mr Bond,

857
01:44:25,174 --> 01:44:29,596
like every great artist, I want to create
an indisputable masterpiece

858
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:32,390
once in my lifetime.

859
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:36,437
The death of 007, "mano a mano",

860
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,397
face to face,

861
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:40,774
will be mine.

862
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:45,070
You mean stuffed and displayed
over your rocky mantelpiece.

863
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:49,199
That's an amusing idea,
but I was thinking in terms of history.

864
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:52,119
A duel between titans.

865
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:55,581
My golden gun against your Walther PPK.

866
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,250
Each of us with a 50-50 chance.

867
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,920
Six bullets to your one?

868
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:04,548
I only need one.

869
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,927
Sounds a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?

870
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:10,888
I mean, pistols at dawn, that sort of thing.

871
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,349
Indeed it is, Mr Bond.

872
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:17,603
But it still remains
the only "true" test for gentlemen.

873
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:21,565
I doubt if you qualify on that score.

874
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,945
However, I accept.

875
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:31,617
As soon as I have finished this delicious
lunch that Nick Nack has prepared for us.

876
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:37,206
"Messieurs", I will remind you,
this is "un duel á la mort".

877
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:41,085
Only one of you
can leave the field of honour.

878
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:44,630
If a "coup de grâce" is necessary,

879
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:49,595
as your referee, I will administer it myself.

880
01:45:49,845 --> 01:45:54,850
"I do not expect wounds, only a clean kill."

881
01:45:55,059 --> 01:46:00,940
"On my command
each contestant will take 20 paces."

882
01:46:01,148 --> 01:46:04,902
Are you ready, Monsieur Scaramanga?

883
01:46:06,571 --> 01:46:09,657
- Ready.
- Are you ready, Monsieur Bond?

884
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:14,453
- Ready.
- I will now begin the count.

885
01:46:14,704 --> 01:46:16,664
One, two,

886
01:46:16,914 --> 01:46:20,126
three, four, five,

887
01:46:20,376 --> 01:46:24,755
six, seven, eight, nine,

888
01:46:25,006 --> 01:46:28,342
ten, eleven, twelve,

889
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:30,595
"thirteen, fourteen,"

890
01:46:30,845 --> 01:46:32,889
fifteen, sixteen,

891
01:46:33,139 --> 01:46:34,765
"seventeen, eighteen,"

892
01:46:35,016 --> 01:46:38,853
nineteen, twenty!

893
01:47:20,562 --> 01:47:22,689
If you kill him,

894
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:26,360
all this be mine.

895
01:47:27,611 --> 01:47:31,240
This way, Monsieur Bond.

896
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:12,656
- Monsieur, good shooting.
- I've never killed a midget before.

897
01:48:12,906 --> 01:48:15,159
But there can always be a first time.

898
01:48:15,368 --> 01:48:18,997
Oh, monsieur!

899
01:49:32,822 --> 01:49:37,327
"You only have three bullets left."

900
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:54,177
"I have fooled you."

901
01:53:13,923 --> 01:53:16,050
- Goodnight!
- James!

902
01:53:16,258 --> 01:53:18,260
Oh, James!

903
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:20,429
Steady, Goodnight.

904
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:22,598
Where is he?

905
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,059
Flat on his "coup de grâce".

906
01:53:25,309 --> 01:53:30,689
Come on, let's get out of this fun palace
and find that solex.

907
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:41,158
Wait here.
I'll take care of the maintenance man.

908
01:53:41,408 --> 01:53:43,327
I already did.

909
01:53:43,577 --> 01:53:45,287
I laid him out cold.

910
01:53:45,537 --> 01:53:47,456
- You did?
- Yes.

911
01:53:47,665 --> 01:53:51,835
There's more to you than meets the eye.

912
01:54:00,219 --> 01:54:04,223
I hate to ask stupid questions, but
where exactly did you knock him cold?

913
01:54:04,515 --> 01:54:07,142
He landed in that one.

914
01:54:07,393 --> 01:54:09,645
Don't you believe in signs?

915
01:54:09,895 --> 01:54:14,692
We've got five minutes before his body
temperature raises the helium above zero.

916
01:54:14,942 --> 01:54:17,403
Then this whole damn place
will go sky-high.

917
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:21,282
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

918
01:55:41,448 --> 01:55:44,660
Kill the beam!

919
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:48,121
- Hit the master override switch!
- The what?

920
01:55:48,413 --> 01:55:50,666
- Goodnight?
- Yes, James?

921
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:54,836
Now listen carefully.
There's a console up there.

922
01:55:55,087 --> 01:56:00,968
Now, there must be a scanner
interlock button on it. Push it!

923
01:56:01,218 --> 01:56:03,262
Are you still there?

924
01:56:03,554 --> 01:56:08,392
It'll be on the auxiliary feedback circuit.

925
01:56:08,433 --> 01:56:11,728
"Computer interlock..." Is that it?

926
01:56:11,979 --> 01:56:15,899
Just push every damn button, will you?

927
01:56:33,292 --> 01:56:35,502
Good girl, Goodnight. You've done it.

928
01:56:35,752 --> 01:56:39,631
Oh, I have.

929
01:57:21,174 --> 01:57:25,929
Goodnight, get the hell out of there!
I've done it.

930
01:57:58,254 --> 01:58:02,174
- I hope you can swim, Goodnight.
- This way.

931
01:58:02,424 --> 01:58:06,638
His junk is moored around the corner.

932
01:59:08,575 --> 01:59:11,369
- But, darling, who is at the wheel?
- George.

933
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,538
George?

934
01:59:13,788 --> 01:59:16,333
Automatic pilot.

935
01:59:16,583 --> 01:59:22,757
We should make Hong Kong
in about... eight hours.

936
01:59:22,965 --> 01:59:26,594
Give or... take a little.

937
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:48,824
I always wanted to take
a slow boat "from" China.

938
02:00:33,871 --> 02:00:36,040
I'll kill you.

939
02:00:36,291 --> 02:00:38,626
I'll kill you!

940
02:00:38,876 --> 02:00:42,463
Why, you...!

941
02:01:30,094 --> 02:01:32,555
Hey! Let me out!

942
02:01:32,805 --> 02:01:35,433
Hey, what are you doing?

943
02:01:35,725 --> 02:01:37,477
Ouch!

944
02:01:37,769 --> 02:01:41,231
No, no, no! I can't breathe!

945
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:43,900
Ow! You'll be sorry.

946
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:47,863
I may be small, but I never forget.

947
02:01:50,616 --> 02:01:53,035
I kill you if you don't let me out of here!

948
02:01:53,285 --> 02:01:56,288
Ow! Let me out, you big bully!

949
02:01:56,538 --> 02:02:00,167
Shut up.

950
02:02:03,796 --> 02:02:07,466
- What did you do with him?
- What do you think?

951
02:02:07,716 --> 02:02:11,762
- Oh, James, you didn't!
- Yes, I damn well did.

952
02:02:11,971 --> 02:02:14,390
Got all the glass out of the bed, I trust?

953
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:18,018
We don't want anything else
to disturb our peace,

954
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:21,939
do we?

955
02:02:26,235 --> 02:02:29,572
Now, where were we?

956
02:02:29,822 --> 02:02:33,409
Oh, James!

957
02:02:34,326 --> 02:02:37,997
Mmm...

958
02:02:42,084 --> 02:02:45,671
What's the matter?

959
02:02:45,963 --> 02:02:49,550
Something came up.

960
02:02:51,385 --> 02:02:52,636
Hello?

961
02:02:52,928 --> 02:02:55,347
Ah, there you are, Bond.

962
02:02:55,598 --> 02:02:58,100
"Well done. Congratulations."

963
02:02:58,350 --> 02:02:59,643
Thank you, sir.

964
02:02:59,852 --> 02:03:02,981
"Is Miss Goodnight with you?
I'd like a word with her."

965
02:03:03,273 --> 02:03:06,860
Hold on, sir.

966
02:03:15,327 --> 02:03:19,122
"Bond? Bond, are you there?"

967
02:03:19,873 --> 02:03:22,542
"Goodnight?"

968
02:03:22,792 --> 02:03:26,380
She's just coming, sir.

969
02:03:31,636 --> 02:03:34,388
Goodnight?

970
02:03:34,931 --> 02:03:38,017
"Goodnight?"

971
02:03:38,267 --> 02:03:41,896
"- Goodnight!
- Good night, sir."

972
02:03:47,652 --> 02:03:51,322
"Good night, good night"

973
02:03:51,489 --> 02:03:55,576
"Sleep well, my dear"

974
02:03:55,785 --> 02:03:59,455
"No need to fear"

975
02:03:59,664 --> 02:04:07,797
"James Bond is here"

976
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:15,264
"Oh, love is required
whenever he's hired"

977
02:04:15,556 --> 02:04:19,351
"It comes just before the kill"

978
02:04:19,643 --> 02:04:21,228
"No one can catch him"

979
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:23,313
"No hit man can match him"

980
02:04:23,605 --> 02:04:26,984
"For his million-dollar skill"

981
02:04:27,192 --> 02:04:31,488
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

982
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:35,993
"Has come to a glittering end"

983
02:04:36,243 --> 02:04:39,454
"If you want to get rid of someone"

984
02:04:39,705 --> 02:04:43,041
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

985
02:04:43,292 --> 02:04:46,545
"Will get it done"

986
02:04:46,795 --> 02:04:50,799
"He'll shoot anyone"

987
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:57,681
"With his golden gun"

988
