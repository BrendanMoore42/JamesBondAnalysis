2
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,373
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,492
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

4
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,339
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

5
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,690
James.

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,052
Be careful.

7
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,898
Well, small world. You're a Toro, too.

8
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,889
I'll see you in Miami.

9
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,449
Fill her up.

10
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,408
EAST BERLIN

11
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,612
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

12
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,812
We should go, my dear.

13
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,613
Well...

14
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,573
You become more beautiful every day.

15
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,453
- I'm over here.
- Of course you are.

16
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,811
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

17
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,692
Miss Smallbone.

18
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,133
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

19
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,535
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

20
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,890
You're such a flatterer, James.

21
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,491
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

22
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,293
So you've told me.

23
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,052
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

24
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,809
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

25
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,694
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

26
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,334
In nauseating detail.

27
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,337
Really?

28
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,896
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

29
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,455
- Good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

30
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,332
- Minister.
- Commander.

31
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,258
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

32
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,336
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

33
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,089
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

34
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,293
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

35
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,297
They're priceless and very rare.

36
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,738
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

37
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,612
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

38
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,810
Except it's a fake.

39
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,853
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

40
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,733
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

41
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,536
It's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

42
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,175
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

43
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,737
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

44
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,772
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

45
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,051
Splendid. I could use
an extra pair of eyes.

46
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,136
We could try and spot the seller.

47
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,651
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

48
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,892
Thank you, Fanning.

49
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,976
Not at all.

50
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,336
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

51
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,258
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

52
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,895
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

53
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,739
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

54
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,090
Operation Trove.

55
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,336
You'll be replacing 009.

56
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,090
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

57
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,256
There's not much to go on.

58
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,655
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

59
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,296
"Property of a Lady."

60
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,848
Next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

61
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,372
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

62
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,217
It seems very thorough.

63
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,729
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

64
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,569
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present

65
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,809
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

66
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,128
- Comrade Chairman.
- General Orlov.

67
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,172
General Gogol is presumptuous.

68
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,019
He speaks for himself and others

69
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,852
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies.

70
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,177
Must I remind you, the committee,

71
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,169
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces

72
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,860
before we give it away?

73
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,573
In East Germany
under my direct command,

74
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,138
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions

75
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,979
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

76
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,855
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

77
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,450
including 22 tank divisions.

78
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,095
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

79
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,815
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

80
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,377
The British maintain only a token force.

81
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,970
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

82
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,255
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

83
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,411
and by five more through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days

84
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,533
against any possible defence scenario.

85
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,650
This is absolute madness.

86
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,532
We know where it will end.

87
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,369
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

88
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,853
Never.

89
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,370
The West is decadent and divided.

90
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,015
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

91
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,092
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

92
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,495
I see no reason to risk war

93
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,296
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

94
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,692
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

95
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,369
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down.

96
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,492
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you.

97
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,252
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

98
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,372
Our military role is strictly defensive.

99
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,253
Is that understood, General Orlov?

100
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,820
General Gogol, would you continue?

101
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,089
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

102
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,815
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

103
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,330
Please. Please.

104
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,815
- I am trying to concentrate.
- Lenkin.

105
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,619
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General.

106
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,096
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

107
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,769
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

108
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,336
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

109
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,055
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General.

110
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,968
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days.

111
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,852
Control yourself.

112
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,337
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

113
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,730
I hope we can reach them in time.

114
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,096
Sold to Busoni.

115
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,378
The next lot is number 48.

116
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,254
A superb green-gold
lmperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

117
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,573
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

118
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,693
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

119
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,133
- How much should it fetch?
- £250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

120
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,536
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.

121
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,172
Property of a Lady.

122
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,532
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

123
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,539
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

124
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,175
I'll start it at £150,000.

125
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,410
150, 60.

126
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,254
170. 170.

127
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,295
180, 190.

128
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,933
200. Against you, madam.

129
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,620
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

130
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,776
£220,000.

131
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,492
240.

132
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,054
James, stick to the business in hand.

133
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,812
£260,000.

134
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,532
280.

135
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,571
£300,000.

136
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,733
And 20?

137
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,850
Are you bidding, sir?

138
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,132
£320,000. New bidder.

139
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,817
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

140
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,057
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

141
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,138
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

142
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,979
£380,000.

143
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,695
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

144
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,130
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

145
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,856
400,000. Any more?

146
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,293
425. New bidder.

147
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,376
Thank you, sir.

148
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,775
- 425.
- Have you gone mad?

149
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,770
Let's see how badly he wants it.

150
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,052
450?

151
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,737
450. 475?

152
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,889
The bid is 450. 475?

153
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,049
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

154
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,338
- Jim?
- The bid is £450,000.

155
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,696
I have 475.

156
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,170
£500,000.

157
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,292
I have half a million pounds. All done?

158
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,776
Any more?

159
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,339
Yours, sir, for £500,000.

160
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,292
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

161
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,651
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

162
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,499
That's what I intend to find out.

163
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,011
You had no business bidding for that egg.

164
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,370
What would you have done if you'd got it?

165
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,175
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

166
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,097
Not paid?

167
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,532
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

168
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,616
Good God.

169
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,940
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

170
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,894
Well, he complains. If he's legitimate.

171
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,216
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

172
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,094
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

173
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,688
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

174
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,018
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he caught a plane to Delhi.

175
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,096
You must go there, too.

176
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,452
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.

177
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,858
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

178
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,216
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

179
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,255
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

180
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,375
Of course, sir.

181
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,698
Charming tune.
You do take English money?

182
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,890
Only gold sovereigns.

183
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,976
Please.

184
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,812
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

185
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,613
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

186
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,777
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Waiting in the taxi.

187
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,812
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes.

188
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,500
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

189
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,331
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

190
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,372
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

191
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,456
Gone ahead.

192
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,935
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

193
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,973
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

194
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,897
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

195
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,252
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

196
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,690
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

197
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,412
Kamal lives there on the hill.

198
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,010
The Monsoon Palace.
It's heavily guarded.

199
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,009
- How do I get to him?
- He plays backgammon at the hotel.

200
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,779
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

201
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,576
- Let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

202
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,851
Here, you may need this
to play with your asp.

203
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,612
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.

204
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,731
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

205
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,816
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

206
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,530
I'm sure I will.

207
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,176
Thank you.

208
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,089
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

209
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,935
- Oh, thank you.
- If I can be of further assistance...

210
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,818
- Anything at all?
- Maybe later.

211
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,009
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

212
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,930
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating this.

213
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,937
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

214
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,136
Of course.

215
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,820
20,000 rupees.

216
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,131
- Always a double six when you need it.
- Always.

217
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,933
- How do you do it.
- It's all in the wrist.

218
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,211
- It's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

219
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,774
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

220
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,858
Your luck's got to run out some time.

221
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,332
May I join you?

222
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,258
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

223
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,535
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

224
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,810
You have a good memory for faces.

225
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,176
And figures.

226
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,697
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

227
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,130
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

228
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,615
Some other time, perhaps?

229
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,936
Thank you.

230
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,132
Six and one.

231
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,728
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

232
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,056
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

233
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,929
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

234
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,852
You win.

235
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,858
I would have taken that double, myself.

236
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,536
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

237
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,412
Bond.

238
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,532
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

239
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,020
100,000 rupees, then.

240
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,532
Double six.

241
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,572
Not such a good double to accept,
after all, was it?

242
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,779
- Double.
- Of course.

243
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,414
You can only win with a double six.

244
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,534
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

245
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,412
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

246
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,932
Don't you?

247
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,489
Play, Mr Bond.

248
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,490
You'll need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

249
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,338
Oh, luck?

250
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,169
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

251
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,337
and use your lucky dice.

252
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,176
It's all in the wrist.

253
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,816
Double sixes.

254
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,256
Fancy that.

255
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,336
200,000 rupees.

256
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,339
I prefer cash.

257
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,016
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,179
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

259
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,053
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

260
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,856
My security.

261
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,336
And yours?

262
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,255
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

263
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,655
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

264
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,974
Thank you.

265
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,537
Vijay will take you from here.
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.

266
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,616
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

267
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,138
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

268
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,730
Thank you.
It's a wonderful racket, this.

269
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,970
- Vijay, we have company.
- No problem. This is a company car.

270
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,175
Step on it.

271
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,294
This should shake 'em off.

272
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,498
Thank God for hard currency.

273
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,608
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

274
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,535
Keep your head down.

275
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,056
Thank you.

276
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,052
Get off my bed.

277
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,017
Here. Catch.

278
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,216
Excuse me.

279
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,729
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

280
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,015
James, over here. Come on.

281
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,659
Vijay. The money I gave you.

282
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,895
Here. Rupees!

283
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,176
Easy come, easy go.

284
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,294
It pays to advertise.

285
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,376
This way, James.

286
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,416
Ah, Q.

287
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,332
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

288
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,372
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

289
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,173
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

290
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,339
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

291
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,815
Pity they missed you.

292
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,408
Karen, see to that, will you?

293
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,691
I've also mislaid my PPK.

294
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,539
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

295
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,612
Blast.

296
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,410
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

297
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,496
Experimental model.

298
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,456
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

299
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,937
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

300
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,891
Very nice, Smithers.

301
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,090
Is the homing device ready yet?

302
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,453
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

303
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,495
It goes in there like that.

304
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,134
Now, take a fountain pen.

305
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,820
Twist the top,

306
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,013
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

307
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,499
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

308
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,009
Pay attention, 007.

309
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,096
Pull the top off the pen.

310
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,054
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

311
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,369
The homing device is compatible with
the radio directional finder in your watch.

312
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,650
If you haven't lost it.

313
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,455
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

314
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,416
What's that?

315
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,930
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

316
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,856
Very handy.

317
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,574
Perfect image, Q.

318
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,497
Really, 007.

319
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,249
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

320
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,897
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

321
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,330
Go on, get along. I've got my work to do.

322
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,496
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

323
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,338
Don't forget this.

324
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,089
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits.

325
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,694
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

326
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,256
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

327
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,132
This way, please.

328
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,576
Thank you.

329
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,254
You changed your mind.

330
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,769
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

331
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,130
Well, let's put it this way.

332
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,096
So far, you are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

333
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,972
Thank you.

334
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,536
So does he have
a proposition for me, or do you?

335
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,616
He suggests a trade.

336
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,891
The egg for your life.

337
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,972
I'd heard the price of eggs
was going up, but isn't that a little high?

338
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,175
Charge it to Room...?

339
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,972
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, I suppose?

340
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,295
I'll leave it at the desk.

341
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,011
You don't mind?

342
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,655
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

343
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,930
It's for me.

344
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,090
So that if I depart this world suddenly,

345
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,008
you'll have something
to remember me by?

346
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,290
Something like that.

347
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,540
It's for my scrapbook. I collect memories.

348
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,417
Well, let's get on with making a few.

349
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,933
I need refilling.

350
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,890
Of course you do.

351
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,690
I'll get some more.

352
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,256
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

353
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,730
What a good idea.

354
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,008
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

355
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,415
That's my little octopussy.

356
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,612
Good morning.

357
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,571
Morning.

358
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,090
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

359
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,178
I can say a proper goodbye.

360
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,896
What is the time?

361
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,656
Beautiful view, isn't it?

362
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,139
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

363
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,613
So right.

364
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,298
In. Out. In. Out.

365
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,414
Come on, girls. In. Out.

366
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,936
Check oars.

367
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,334
The egg has been recovered.

368
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,732
You should be pleased.

369
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,216
I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

370
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,099
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

371
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,452
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

372
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,334
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

373
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,770
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

374
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,408
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

375
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,089
Likes eggs. Preferably Fabergé.

376
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,859
And dice. Preferably loaded.

377
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,130
His name is James Bond.

378
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,692
Bring him here.

379
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,018
He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

380
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,492
No.

381
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,216
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".

382
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,218
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

383
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,457
But you're making a serious mistake.

384
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,136
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

385
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,095
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

386
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,018
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

387
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,892
Well rested?

388
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,137
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

389
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,175
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

390
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,978
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

391
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,769
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

392
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,414
may I ask exactly why I am here?

393
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,418
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

394
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,812
True. But we don't have all the answers.

395
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,252
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?

396
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,736
Don't worry, you will.

397
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,135
Let me guess.

398
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,569
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

399
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,056
Hardly. We're much more
sophisticated than that.

400
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,530
- Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

401
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,609
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

402
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,890
Guaranteed results.

403
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,218
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

404
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,812
One of our specialities.

405
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,618
Stuffed sheep's head.

406
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:32,773
It's odd, but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.

407
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,729
Oh, thank you for dinner.

408
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,856
Until tomorrow, then.

409
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,132
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

410
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,694
Some other time, perhaps.

411
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,698
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap? No.

412
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,133
I trust you had a pleasant flight.

413
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,779
If you step this way,
I think you will find everything is in order.

414
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,939
Congratulations on the quality of
your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

415
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,298
Thank you, General Orlov.

416
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,493
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

417
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,771
according to Lenkin's specifications.

418
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,771
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

419
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,539
- Can they be trusted?
- I assure you oftheir silence.

420
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,854
We are both playing for enormous stakes.

421
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,338
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

422
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,452
Exactly...

423
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,652
The precise timing will be essential.

424
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,735
Remember: Nothing must be changed.

425
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,296
One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

426
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,700
- Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Correct.

427
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,214
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

428
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,855
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice ofthe thief.

429
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,017
He must be eliminated at once.

430
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,537
There must be no further security breach.

431
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,811
This fake has caused enough trouble.

432
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,655
I must go.

433
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,139
Everything has been most satisfactory.

434
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,296
Most kind, General Orlov.

435
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,168
Get Bond.

436
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,615
The Englishman has escaped.

437
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,574
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

438
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,778
Good.

439
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,175
Let the sport commence.

440
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,612
Head him off.

441
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,618
Sit!

442
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,492
We have him.

443
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,613
Go round. He's in there.

444
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,656
Hiss off.

445
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,254
Don't let him get away.

446
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,495
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

447
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,890
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

448
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,172
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.
