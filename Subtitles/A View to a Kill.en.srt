1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:02,255
My name is Elena Gilbert.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,571
I'm a new vampire, and there
have been complications.

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,337
I know that I'm sired
to you, Damon.

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,839
You know what would
make me happy?

5
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:11,558
That what you actually felt for me
was real.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,360
But there's hope
now there's a cure.

7
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:15,979
This cure has ruined us, and it
hasn't even been found yet.

8
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,481
What do you know
about Silas?

9
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,349
He's the world's first
immortal being,

10
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,318
who just happens
to be the person with the cure.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,237
Unlikely alliances
have formed.

12
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,321
What the hell
are you doing here?

13
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:25,289
How can I help?

14
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,525
No feelings.
No attachment.

15
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,713
To make sure we
never find the cure.

16
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,331
You're going to find
Jeremy Gilbert,

17
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,999
and you're going to
kill him.

18
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,835
Our only
chance is to risk everything.

19
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,219
Kol compelled Damon
to kill you.

20
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,505
You're gonna kill
Kol instead.

24
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,398
I don't appreciate you
invading my privacy

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,367
like some kind of
creeping Tom.

26
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,101
Well, I apologize
for breaking up

27
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:47,237
this sordid little tryst,

28
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,239
but I do have some
urgent business.

29
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,375
Or have you forgotten
that our paranoid brother Kol

30
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,776
is running around
with a white oak stake

31
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,411
and homicide on
the brain?

32
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,296
He tried to kill me last night.
I didn't forget.

33
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:58,165
Yes. Well,
unfortunately,

34
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,884
he seems to have absconded with my
set of daggers.

35
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,887
Oh, poor Nik. However will you
get your way

36
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,589
without your
precious daggers?

37
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,841
They were so handy when you
wanted to end a conversation

38
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,259
with one of us.

39
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,261
Kol's irrational
fear of Silas

40
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,080
has pushed him
off the edge.

41
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,149
We need to put him down before
he does any more damage.

42
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,733
Now, I know you have
the last dagger,

43
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,486
and I know you have
some white ash, so hand it over.

44
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:23,073
Hmm. And leave myself
unprotected?

45
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,610
You can file that request
under "no chance in hell."

46
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,744
Be gone by the time
I've showered.

47
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:30,164
Lurkers aren't
welcome here.

48
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:36,936
I need that dagger, Stefan.

49
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,091
Talk some sense
into her.

50
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,159
Why don't you
talk some sense into her?

51
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,879
I'm headed home to play
prison guard to Damon.

52
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,831
He's on lockdown
ever since Kol compelled him

53
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,099
to kill Jeremy
last night.

54
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,186
You see? That's
my point exactly.

55
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,671
If you let Kol
run free,

56
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:57,057
then Jeremy won't live to see
his junior prom,

57
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,343
and we can kiss
our map to the cure good-bye.

58
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,864
But if you help me
dagger Kol,

59
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,116
Damon will be
uncompelled,

60
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,318
Jeremy will live, and we'll all be
on our merry way

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,821
to a human Elena.

62
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,325
Where are you?

63
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,994
I told Caroline
I'd take her place

64
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,997
at decade dance prep,
but none of the rest of you showed.

65
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,165
I know. I'm sorry.
I had to, though.

66
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,550
I've got Jeremy
under house arrest

67
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:25,969
because Kol wants
to kill him.

68
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,370
And Klaus
wants to take him

69
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:30,474
on some vampire-slaying
road trip.

70
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,209
And since neither
of them were invited in,

71
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,646
it's the only place
that I can keep him safe.

72
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,065
Why does it sound like
you're under fire?

73
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,851
Apparently I'm living
in a fraternity house now.

74
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,069
I'm training.

75
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,219
Me, too.

76
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,055
Train yourself to
do some dishes.

77
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,356
And put these
weapons away

78
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:50,527
before someone tries to
use one on me.

79
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,579
Well, it's hard for me to
look forward to this dance

80
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,231
while you're trapped
in your house.

81
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,918
Listen, I have a plan
to put an end to all of this.

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,871
I want Jeremy
to kill Kol.

83
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,073
You want him to kill
an original?

84
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,625
Think about it.

85
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,711
Kol's sire line must
stretch to the moon by now.

86
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:11,348
If Jeremy kills Kol, every vampire
that he's ever turned,

87
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,302
not to mention everyone that
they've turned, will die,

88
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:17,771
which means the Hunter's mark
will be complete,

89
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,724
and we'll have our key
to finding the cure.

90
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:24,761
I'm on my way.
We'll figure it out.

91
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,446
Do you think Caroline
will notice

92
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,399
if there's only 89
red balloons?

93
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,402
Actually, probably yes.

94
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,788
Aah!

95
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:41,995
What happened?

96
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,298
I don't know.

97
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,067
There's something
in the water.

98
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,318
Are you serious?

99
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,054
You dumped vervain
into the water supply?

100
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,089
Where did you even
get it?

101
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,724
I have my sources.

102
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,258
I'm also reinstating
the curfew

103
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,977
and canceling
all town events.

104
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,478
Dad, there's
the dance tonight.

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,846
Not anymore.

106
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:01,431
Are you serious?

107
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,900
Honey, I'm trying
to protect you, not punish you.

108
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,969
The well-being
of this town is my job now.

109
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,105
No. Dad, it's mine,
and I've been doing fine

110
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,356
without you getting
involved.

111
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:10,741
You've been doing fine?

112
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,975
Would you like me
to read you all the names

113
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,744
of the people that have
gone missing

114
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,147
or died in tragic accidents
in your senior year alone?

115
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,332
Head straight home,
please.

116
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,151
We're having
a family meeting.

117
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:25,922
No one can get
to the cure

118
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,175
if you're too dead
to find it.

119
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:36,516
Aah! Aah! Aah!

120
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:40,136
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

121
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,373
Gonna snap my neck again?

122
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,918
Because I woke up
feeling completely unmurderous,

123
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,555
and I'm pretty sure
that it's safe to set me free.

124
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:25,649
You practically
bled me dry.

125
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,351
At least spring for
a bag or something.

126
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,570
I'm thirsty.

127
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,763
Not exactly what I had in mind.

128
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:40,197
Uh. Uh.

129
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,295
Hello mate.

130
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,208
What the hell
are you doing here?

131
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,210
Babysitting.

132
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,378
Oh.

133
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,248
Give him a vial of blood
every couple of hours

134
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,383
so he doesn't desiccate.

135
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,352
If he gets too much
strength back

136
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,971
or if he just
annoys you,

137
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,107
bleed him out again.

138
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:13,613
Is that your best shot?

139
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,366
He's still pissed at me
for sleeping with Elena.

140
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,951
Are you sure
about that?

141
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,453
Because I caught him
trying to sneak out

142
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,437
of Rebekah's bed
this morning,

143
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,542
which would suggest
to me that he's moved on.

144
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,545
Well, well. Looks
like my brother

145
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:32,615
ripped out a page
of my revenge sex handbook.

146
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,085
Well, why don't you two
enjoy your little, uh,

147
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,420
villain bonding time?

148
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:40,674
I'll let you know when I get
the dagger from Rebekah.

149
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:57,355
Damon's fine.

150
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,776
With all the creature
comforts he deserves.

151
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,578
That's not
why I called.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,698
Kol just tried
to kill Bonnie.

153
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,750
What? Is she ok?

154
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,585
Yeah, just
shaken up.

155
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,652
She managed to
hold him off,

156
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,254
but Kol seems
pretty intent

157
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,290
on murdering anyone who's looking
for that cure.

158
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,208
Yeah. Klaus has me
trying to convince Rebekah

159
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,794
to give up her dagger
so we can take care of Kol.

160
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,330
I don't want to
just dagger Kol.

161
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,516
I want Jeremy
to kill him.

162
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,273
What did you
just say?

163
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,642
Bonnie says she's got
all this crazy new power.

164
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:33,944
She thinks she can
hold him long enough

165
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,345
for Jeremy to get
a clean shot.

166
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,846
And then what, huh?

167
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:37,981
Klaus and Rebekah
will kill every single one of us

168
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,399
out of spite.

169
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:41,902
They may be
dysfunctional, bickering lunatics,

170
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,370
but they stick
together no matter what.

171
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,905
That's why you need
to find the dagger

172
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,357
and use it on Rebekah.

173
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,858
She can't come looking
for revenge

174
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,411
if she's lying in a box.

175
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,082
I know you can't because
vampires can't use the dagger,

176
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,884
but Matt can.

177
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:02,205
It's not like she
doesn't deserve it.

178
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,841
And Bonnie thinks that she can
get Klaus out of the picture, too,

179
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,542
at least temporarily.

180
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:09,212
Once we get this cure,
none of this will matter

181
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,431
because we can use it
against them.

182
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:16,236
All right, fine,
but how do you plan to lure Kol in?

183
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,577
Jeremy Gilbert.

184
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,196
Nice to see I'm still
on your speed dial, mate.

185
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,416
Hey, you want to meet up
at the batting cages in Denver?

186
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:32,452
Actually,
it's Elena Gilbert.

187
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,004
What a treat.

188
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,905
Yeah, I was just
thinking of all the clever ways

189
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,757
I could have
your brother killed,

190
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,210
but I'd settle
for ripping off

191
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,411
his illustrated arm
instead.

192
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:45,348
I need to talk
to you--in person.

193
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,219
I want to call
a truce in the name of Silas.

194
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,724
I'll meet you
wherever you want.

195
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,226
I'll come to you.

196
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,028
I'll tell you what.

197
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,646
How about
I come to you?

198
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,105
Open the door
and invite me in.

199
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:16,862
I'm waiting.

200
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,748
Let me in, and let's
talk truce.

201
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:23,614
Hello?

202
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,237
Wouldn't it be kind of
stupid to invite you in?

203
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,822
On the contrary.

204
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,407
I can't kill your brother with
my own two hands,

205
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,108
or I'll suffer
the hunter's curse

206
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,611
and spend the next
20 years trying to off myself

207
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,330
in gruesome ways.

208
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,116
And I've heard that vervain's
back in town,

209
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:41,086
so I can't compel you
to kill him either.

210
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:43,589
So I think it's fair to say

211
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,926
you're semi-safe,
for now.

212
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:49,895
He's the only one who can
invite him inside.

213
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:53,966
He's right,
obviously.

214
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,441
You'd think being
alive for over 1,000 years

215
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,276
would teach me
some manners,

216
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,012
but I couldn't
resist stopping by.

217
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,164
If I let you in,
my brother goes.

218
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,001
You're not
getting near him.

219
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,619
Fair enough.

220
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,549
You can come in.

221
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,719
No gold medal for bravery,
I see.

222
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:27,099
Another thing I love
about the modern age

223
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:30,853
is music anytime
you like.

224
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,873
So, is the part

225
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:36,800
where you offer
me a drink

226
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,350
so we can have
a proper chat.

227
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,831
The colors, the fabric,

228
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,315
the eighties
were just tragic.

229
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,084
You know, I think
shoulder pads

230
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:58,788
rival 17th-century Puritan
smocks for crimes against fashion.

231
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,423
Looking for something
to wear to the dance?

232
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,626
Aye. Are you
asking me to a date?

233
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:06,995
Actually,
it was canceled.

234
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,136
So why are you here?

235
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,355
Back for more
dagger talk?

236
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,640
Somebody has
some trust issues.

237
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:21,277
It's called
a healthy skepticism.

238
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,562
I know you were trying
to sneak out this morning.

239
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:24,747
I'm not stupid.

240
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:26,582
Sorry.

241
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,618
I'm still trying
to get used to this.

242
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,619
Do you regret it?

243
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:31,720
No.

244
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:34,140
Do you want it
to happen again?

245
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,161
Maybe.

246
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,910
Even if I don't
give you the dagger?

247
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,612
You think that
I would sleep with you

248
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:43,963
just to get
the dagger?

249
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,083
Don't give me
that innocent look.

250
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:48,284
You've done
plenty to me

251
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:49,736
in the name of
getting what you want.

252
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,722
Well, I guess I should pack up
these racks.

253
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,257
Just another
failed attempt

254
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,959
at getting to
a high-school dance.

255
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,728
Why do you care so much
about a high school dance?

256
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,815
I don't.
I was just bored.

257
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,433
Right.

258
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:08,075
Well, we can still go.
If you want?

259
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,574
Not if it's
canceled, we can't.

260
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:13,660
Since when do you
care about the rules?

261
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,148
You know, none of this
would be an issue

262
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,085
if you'd have just
done your job properly.

263
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:25,004
I was perfectly
willing to let you train Jeremy.

264
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,156
No, you weren't.
Are you kidding?

265
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,175
You got there
on day two.

266
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:30,660
Do you know how
hard it is to get

267
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:32,662
these X-Box brains
to focus?

268
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:35,298
And then when I turned
a room full of barflies

269
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,016
into vampires
for him to slaughter,

270
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,968
you let Kol kill them.

271
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,354
Your brother problem,
not mine, buddy.

272
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:42,672
And whose bright idea
was it

273
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:45,275
to saddle Jeremy
with a conscience, hmm?

274
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,277
Well, we couldn't
have him trying to stake Elena

275
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,862
in her sleep,
now, could we?

276
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,898
Ah, yes, for
the love of Elena.

277
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,683
How is it that she manages
to overlook

278
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,285
every horrific thing
you've ever done?

279
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,120
Is it willful
ignorance

280
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:58,821
or perhaps something
more pathological?

281
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:00,657
Some people
are just more capable

282
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,292
of forgiveness than others.

283
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,828
Bet you score about a negative 500
in that realm.

284
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,998
Come on. There
must be a secret.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,334
It can't just be the sire bond.
What is it?

286
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,835
Compulsion?

287
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,870
Manipulation?

288
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,058
What is it you say to her?

289
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,397
I think this has
something to do

290
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,491
with a certain
blond vampire.

291
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:36,626
I think you murdered
Carol Lockwood,

292
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,127
and I think
you're worried

293
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,997
that Caroline's never
going to forgive you.

294
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,465
You've done worse.

295
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:47,303
Debatable. See,
I don't mind being the bad guy,

296
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,472
because somebody has to fill
that role and get things done.

297
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:52,642
You do bad things
for no reason.

298
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,477
You do them
to be a dick.

299
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,013
Debatable.

300
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,682
If you're gonna be bad,
be bad with purpose.

301
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,569
Otherwise you're just
not worth forgiving.

302
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:17,816
Sorry, I have to take up
the old people alcohol.

303
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:22,839
Yeah, that's the problem
with people today.

304
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,507
They have no
drinking imagination.

305
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,643
Turn-of-the-century
New Orleans--

306
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,061
now, they knew
how to make a drink.

307
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:29,712
You lived
in New Orleans?

308
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,397
We all did,

309
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,216
till Niklaus shoved
a dagger in my heart.

310
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,552
Why? What did you do?

311
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:38,688
What makes you think
I did anything?

312
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,056
Has your alliance
with my brother

313
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,692
softened you
to his horrors?

314
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:45,695
I don't have
an alliance with Klaus.

315
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,730
We had a mutual interest
in finding the cure.

316
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,082
That's all.

317
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,083
Had?

318
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,901
Yes.

319
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:53,536
And I'm willing to
give up looking for it

320
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:56,623
if you promise to
leave my brother alone.

321
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,953
Now can you teach me
how to make this?

322
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:07,282
I'll get some ice.

323
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,272
Bonnie where are you,

324
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,741
I've called, like,
17 times.

325
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,545
Kol is in our house.
We need you.

326
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,747
Ok, I'm headed
to your house now.

327
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,285
Would you like one?

328
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,305
Sure. Why not?

329
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
You're really good at that game.

330
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,827
Especially considering
you've been locked up in a coffin

331
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,078
for a hundred years.

332
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,997
I'm a quick learner.

333
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,630
Speedy reflexes.

334
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,551
It's not much like the
real thing, though, is it?

335
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,761
You have killed, haven't you?

336
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:08,111
Or are you one of those
Mary Sue vampires?

337
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:12,891
I killed...once.

338
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,801
I'm guessing your number is
a lot higher than mine.

339
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:19,071
You lose track over the years.

340
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,191
So are we going
to talk about Silas

341
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,991
or just jibber jabber?

342
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,991
No one else seems
to think Silas exists.

343
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,470
So why do you?

344
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,941
I used to run with some witches

345
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,101
in Africa in the 14th century,

346
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:57,441
Haiti in the 17th century,

347
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,331
New Orleans in the 1900s.

348
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:01,371
They all knew about Silas

349
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,921
and that he needed to stay buried.

350
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,891
I actually hold witches
in high esteem.

351
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,581
Yeah, but why Silas?

352
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,711
Why are you so afraid of him?

353
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,560
They said if Silas rises,

354
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,901
he'll unleash hell on earth.

355
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,541
I happen to like earth just the way it is.

356
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,591
That's pretty Biblical.

357
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,161
Well, that's the other
problem with people today.

358
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:24,941
They've lost faith,

359
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,841
and in that loss, they no longer
know who they should fear.

360
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:37,799
I have to get to Elena.

361
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,771
Have you seen my phone?

362
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:41,531
I've got your phone, and
I've got your car keys.

363
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,571
And I told you we are
having a family meeting.

364
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,399
Is that something you read in a book?

365
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,619
Because we have never had a family meeting.

366
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,901
I've let this go on long enough.

367
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,501
Shane said you and your magic
are like a ticking time bomb.

368
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:55,401
And I told you he's crazy.

369
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,921
I lost your mother to witchcraft.

370
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,511
I don't intend to lose you.

371
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,451
It's not your life. It's mine.

372
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,531
Hey, is Bonnie here?

373
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,391
She's busy.

374
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:15,861
It's important.

375
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:16,841
What's going on?

376
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,691
I've called you, like, a hundred times.

377
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,131
Kol is in our house.

378
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,451
- I have to go. - I said no.

379
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,571
Stop telling me what to do!

380
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,051
No one's going anywhere!

381
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,221
Mom?

382
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,911
Abby, please come in.

383
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:50,261
What are you doing here?

384
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:53,301
Your father called. Who's Professor Shane?

385
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,919
What has he been teaching you?

386
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,219
Bonnie, we don't have time for this.

387
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,771
This is a family matter.

388
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,989
My sister's in trouble.
We need Bonnie's help.

389
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,881
My daughter is done
helping Elena Gilbert.

390
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,821
- Now get out. - Mom!

391
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,261
Answer my question.

392
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,541
What lies has this professor
been telling you?

393
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,860
Don't! Jeremy!
Hey, stop!

394
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:14,801
Stop.

395
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,101
Don't hurt her.
She's my mom.

396
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,351
Look at me.

397
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,771
Just go, Okay?

398
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:32,201
I'm right behind you.

399
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,151
You wanna talk?

400
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,181
Let's talk.

401
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,301
But I think this is a good year.

402
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,061
What if I said
I don't believe you?

403
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:58,761
Ok, you got me. I don't know
anything about wine.

404
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:03,499
Just seems odd that
you being so willing

405
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,161
to give up something
you want so much.

406
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,681
I would do anything
for my brother.

407
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:12,531
And if what you're saying
about Silas is true.

408
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:14,631
What does it matter what I want

409
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,531
if it puts everyone else
in danger?

410
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:22,631
Well, this has been a enlightening.

411
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,431
Thanks for the drinks.

412
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,491
I'll take your request
for truth under advisement.

413
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:38,651
Is there any chance that
you can be wrong about Silas?

414
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,741
Trust me, Elena.

415
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:44,861
Some things are better left buried.

416
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,731
Think I saw a horror movie
that started just like this.

417
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,851
Did you know they play movies
on TV all night long now?

418
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:03,471
Hundreds of them.

419
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,499
So much better than those silly

420
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,851
black-and-white picture
shows we use to go to.

421
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:11,821
I don't know.

422
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,401
Kind of miss the old ones.

423
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,381
You got any requests for the DJ?

424
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,381
I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy.

425
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,731
Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.

426
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,281
- Hope you like the cure. - Funny.

427
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,491
So is everything
about the eighties so...

428
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,221
excessive?

429
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,031
I think, it had its charm.

430
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,291
"Say anything"--

431
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,509
Lloyd Dobler standing outside
of a bedroom window

432
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,991
with a boombox over his head

433
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,441
desperately trying to get back
the girl of his dreams.

434
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:47,421
"Princess Bride"--

435
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,941
Wesley slays giant rats for love.

436
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,289
"Breakfast Club"-- one detention

437
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,371
turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.

438
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,731
So it was a decade of
sentimental drivel, as well.

439
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,261
Well, I was gonna
say love, friendship,

440
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:05,651
Possibility of anything happening.

441
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,981
You would've loved it.

442
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,770
And why is that?

443
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,311
Because, as much as we
both hate to admit it,

444
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,051
we care about those things.

445
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,811
That better not be a corsage.

446
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:27,851
I loathe corsages.

447
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,091
These were all the rage in the eighties.

448
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,271
Let's dance.

449
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,190
I'm sorry. He left.

450
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,741
I mean, I tried to stall
as long as I could.

451
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,161
That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.

452
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:31,891
I've considered
your request for truce.

453
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,481
Request denied.

454
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,891
I'm sorry. I've already
been invited in.

455
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,211
Hide and seek?

456
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,601
Fine by me.

457
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:50,139
Dad needs to mind
his own business,

458
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,769
he had no right to call you here.

459
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,521
It's not just your father, Bonnie.

460
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,589
Witches talk. Word gets around.

461
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,399
I found a new way to practice.

462
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,689
It's unconventional,
but I can handle myself, I promise.

463
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,079
That's not what Shane said.

464
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,731
Shane is sitting
in a jail cell right now.

465
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,511
You're gonna take
his word over mine?

466
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,909
I've warned you
about dark magic before.

467
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,071
It's not dark magic.
It's expression, and I need it.

468
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,161
They found a cure, Mom.

469
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,041
There's a cure for vampirism,

470
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:21,101
and I can
do the spell to access it.

471
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:25,361
I can save you,
but I have to go...

472
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,811
Now.

473
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:30,721
I'm not the one
that needs to be saved.

474
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:33,831
You are.

475
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,701
Your brother's lack of
communication is infuriating.

476
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,881
It's one of his trademarks,

477
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,871
like his brooding and his hair.

478
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:52,651
I don't understand
what's taking so long.

479
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:54,909
I mean, how hard is it
to steal a dagger?

480
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,736
From the vampire
who's been stabbed by it

481
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:57,980
as many times as your sister,

482
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:59,511
I'd say difficult.

483
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:06,081
Sweet.

484
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,511
You disappoint me, Damon.

485
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,269
You're not trying very hard
to get out of here.

486
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,321
I expected more the daring escape artist,

487
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,771
less the cell potato.

488
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:18,649
Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy,

489
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,999
so I figured it's probably smarter

490
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,999
to sit in there
and chitchat with you

491
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,951
than try to bust out of here
like the Hulk.

492
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,461
How do you think Elena
felt about that, by the way.

493
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:30,569
Your inability to overcome
Kol's compulsion for a single moment,

494
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,009
even though it meant
killing the person

495
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,591
she loves the most in the world?

496
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,391
She's met me.

497
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:38,321
She knows impulse control
is not my strong suit.

498
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:41,010
Still, must be hard

499
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,661
trying to live up to Stefan.

500
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:47,991
I remember when I compelled
him to feed on Elena,

501
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,291
he fought so hard,
he actually managed to resist.

502
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:54,121
Now, that's love.

503
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:56,101
What do you know about love?

504
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:58,061
I know that you're
in love with Elena,

505
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,109
but I think you're afraid
of what might happen

506
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,211
when we find the cure
at the end of the rainbow.

507
00:27:03,351 --> 00:27:06,611
Personally, I don't see
a fairy-tale ending for you?

508
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,561
All I see is Stefan and Elena.

509
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,311
I think you see the same thing.

510
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,081
Well, if it isn't the
happy homicidal maniac.

511
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,889
Do you know that your
darling former blood bag

512
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,370
and her brother
are trying to kill me?

513
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,040
What?

514
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,399
Don't pretend like
you're not in on it.

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,349
Your obsession to find the cure

516
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,931
clearly trumps any sibling
loyalty you once felt.

517
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,829
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,431
I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm

519
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:42,721
and kill Elena just for sport.

520
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:44,421
Then I'm coming for you.

521
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,861
What the hell is going on?

522
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,381
I don't know.

523
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,211
What are Stefan
and Elena planning?

524
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:03,300
I don't know.

525
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:05,901
I've been stuck in the penalty box
with you since yesterday.

526
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:07,689
Stefan won't talk to me,

527
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,821
And Elena won't come to see me.

528
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,751
So maybe you're right.
Maybe she's written me off.

529
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,391
Tell me what you know.

530
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,141
I don't know anything about a plan.

531
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,241
You stay here till I return.

532
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,381
I will stay here until you return...

533
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,071
or not.

534
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,381
It's amazing which you can find
stashed away in the teachers' lounge.

535
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,211
This song is not as terrible
as the other ones.

536
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,631
This song is the Godfather
of rock anthems, ok?

537
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:03,991
What's going on with you?

538
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,871
You're... fun tonight.

539
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,489
I can't listen to this music

540
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,441
without thinking of my best friend Lexi.

541
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:13,671
We spent most of the eighties together.

542
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,039
I remember this one time
she snuck us backstage

543
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,249
and compelled half the band
to do tequila shots

544
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,641
with us before the show.

545
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,181
She was fearless, kind of like you.

546
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:25,801
So you slept with her, too?

547
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,091
No. It wasn't like that.

548
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,691
I was just a better person
when I was with her.

549
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,581
I didn't think
I'd ever feel that way again.

550
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,181
Until Elena.

551
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,871
Until Elena.

552
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,241
And now that's over.

553
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,291
That look right there,

554
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,731
that is why I don't let myself care.

555
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:54,921
Well, you can say that,

556
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,491
But we both know
it's not true.

557
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:04,871
Don't worry.

558
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,821
I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way

559
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:08,531
to this abandoned dance.

560
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,111
I think I'll choose next song.

561
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,641
No. You know what?
I've a better idea.

562
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,351
That way.

563
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,921
Will, you coming?

564
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:01,400
Uh!

565
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,491
Missed.

566
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,251
Go!

567
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:09,039
Aah! Uh!

568
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:39,181
Now, About that arm.

569
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:02,651
Like that!

570
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,780
This is ridiculous.

571
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:08,359
Well, that's the whole point
of the "Breakfast Club" slide.

572
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,191
It's supposed to be ridiculous.

573
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:13,091
No. That's--

574
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:14,849
That's cheating.

575
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,879
What is fun about hurtling down a hallway

576
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,431
like a teenage imbecile?

577
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,191
You're just gonna have
to do it to find out.

578
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,621
All right. It's the shoes.

579
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:35,961
Take off your shoes, you'll be fine, ok?

580
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,361
This is what you want right?

581
00:32:58,261 --> 00:32:59,351
Go ahead.

582
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:00,971
Take care.

583
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,101
You're right, I do care.

584
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:10,980
I want stupid koala corsages

585
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,501
and a prom.

586
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:15,240
I want to have kids with someone

587
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:16,491
who loves me enough to stand

588
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:18,531
outside my window with a stupid boombox.

589
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:21,891
I want to be human.

590
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,041
So let Klaus put down my brother.

591
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,091
Let's go find the cure.

592
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:45,891
Come on, let's go.

593
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,411
You dragged her?

594
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,831
Just enough to keep her down

595
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,881
until I can get some witches here

596
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,699
to clean her mind from that poison

597
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,331
that professor has been teaching her.

598
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,271
That's not happening.

599
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:16,921
Bonnie, please.

600
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:21,229
Aah! Oh!
Bonnie--

601
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,661
I don't belong to
the spirits anymore.

602
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,291
I belong to myself. Sorry.

603
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,311
Now, like I said, I don't
fancy the hunter's curse.

604
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,391
So I'm just gonna chop off
your arm, but don't worry.

605
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,361
I'll heal you right up with
a bit of blood after.

606
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:57,881
Sorry about the sting.

607
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,561
Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right?

608
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,721
I'll just chop off both to be safe.

609
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,271
Jeremy! Now!

610
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:10,841
What did you do?

611
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,791
We didn't have a choice.

612
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,081
He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm.

613
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:16,371
Lies.

614
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,109
He never would've gotten

615
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,319
inside if you hadn't have
set a trap for him.

616
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,141
You said you were gonna
put him down, too.

617
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,531
I was gonna make him
suffer on my terms!

618
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,841
I want to burn this house
to the ground,

619
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:34,101
and then when you try
to flee for your lives,

620
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,939
I'll kill you both without blinking.

621
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,689
You kill us, you'll never
get to the cure.

622
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,141
You'll never be able to make
any more hybrids.

623
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:44,001
You really think I care for an instant
about my bloody hybrids?

624
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:46,239
I want the cure so I can destroy it.

625
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,479
I would've killed you all
the second we dug it up,

626
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,951
but now I'm just gonna watch
you burn instead.

627
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,011
Invite him in.

628
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:58,841
Do it.

629
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:06,471
Come in.

630
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,121
Living room. Go.

631
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:31,340
Witch, you can't do this to me.

632
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:33,851
You have no idea what I can do now.

633
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:38,491
I will hunt all of you
to your end!

634
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:42,451
Do you hear me? Do you?

635
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,481
I don't believe you.

636
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,311
Kol is not dead. He can't be.

637
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:57,569
Listen, Rebekah.
They didn't have a choice.

638
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,661
Kol started this when
he went after Jeremy.

639
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:01,741
He went after you, too.
Do you remember?

640
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,791
I mean, he was never gonna
let us find the cure.

641
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,341
So you knew.

642
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,031
This whole night, you knew.

643
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:09,772
I'm not gonna let the people
that I care about get hurt.

644
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,981
Not Jeremy, not Elena,
not even Damon.

645
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:14,801
And you can hate me for it.

646
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,571
Now he can't hurt you, either.

647
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,601
And I want us to find
this cure together,

648
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:20,721
you and me.

649
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,171
Not just for Elena, but for you.

650
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:26,109
So you can have what you want.

651
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,731
You can be who you want.

652
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:29,671
You can be human again.

653
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:36,531
Everyone deserves
a second chance right?

654
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:40,281
Why would I trust you?

655
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,451
I don't know.

656
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:48,471
I guess I could give you my word,

657
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,731
but at the end of the day
you'll just have to take a leap.

658
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,259
Didn't work.

659
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,781
It took time for
Finn's line to die off.

660
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:09,011
Remember? It'll work.

661
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:10,539
What if it doesn't?

662
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,441
Where's that Gilbert optimism?

663
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,311
Sorry I missed all the excitement.

664
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,131
I'm just happy to see you.

665
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:40,131
So I guess I didn't miss much.

666
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,001
Got the Silas's headstone.

667
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,771
We're just waiting for
Jeremy's mark to grow.

668
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:56,751
- Klaus is trapped in our living room.
- Temporarily.

669
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:59,881
I drawn the new moon
to bind the spell.

670
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:03,661
Got three days to find
that cure, four max.

671
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,399
If we don't, we might as well
look up Katherine Pierce

672
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,581
and see if she wants
some company in hiding.

673
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,061
'cuz he will come after us.

674
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,681
We'll find it.

675
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:13,061
Now we've got Rebekah taken care of,

676
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:15,319
all we need is Professor Shane,

677
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,641
and we'll have
everything we need.

678
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:19,681
Yeah, I didn't uh...I didn't dagger her.

679
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,291
What? Why not?

680
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,311
I didn't need to, she's on our side.

681
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:26,091
On our side?

682
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:28,299
Did you really just say that?

683
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,989
Yeah. She handed
over the headstone,

684
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,491
I mean she wants to find this cure
more than anyone of us.

685
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:36,281
Why would you possibly think
that you could trust her?

686
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,889
Let me guess. She pledged her allegiance

687
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,561
to you while you were naked in the sack.

688
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:52,361
I bet you're just dying to get
that out, Weren't you Damon?

689
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,369
Oh was this supposed to be secret?

690
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,629
Maybe you should make that a little clearer

691
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,531
while you're bleeding me dry in our cellar.

692
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,541
Yeah. To keep you
from killing Jeremy.

693
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,121
Stop it, both of you.

694
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:03,211
Now why don't you tell her
to calm down, Damon?

695
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:07,691
You've managed to use that sire bond
pretty well so far, haven't you?

696
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:24,741
It's happening.

697
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:27,281
My God.

698
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:30,841
What? You can see it?

699
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:46,561
Here we go.
