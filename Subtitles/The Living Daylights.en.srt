00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,413
Gentlemen,

3
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,409
this may only be an exercise so far as
the Ministry of Defence is concerned,

4
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,331
but for me it is a matter of pride that the
00-Section has been chosen for this test.

5
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,011
Your objective is to penetrate
the radar installations of Gibraltar.

6
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,132
The SAS have been placed
on full alert to intercept you,

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,615
but I know you won't let me down.

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,252
Good luck, men.

9
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,312
Oh, blast!

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,232
Damn!

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,839
That's it, chum. You're out of it.

12
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,754
Game's up, mate. You're dead.

13
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,592
No!

14
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,951
Halt.

15
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,996
Here! Hold on, you're dead!

16
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,555
It's all so boring here, Margot. There's
nothing but playboys and tennis pros.

17
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,071
If only I could find a real man!

18
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,836
I need to use your phone.

19
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,349
She'll call you back.

20
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,877
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

21
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,037
Exercise control, 007 here.
I'll report in an hour.

22
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,195
Won't you join me?

23
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,392
Better make that two.

24
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,197
BRATISLAVA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA

25
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,037
Saunders, head of Section V, Vienna.
You're bloody late.

26
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,833
This is a mission, not a fancy-dress ball.

27
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,396
We have time.

28
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,268
- Now, where's our man?
- In the box. Between the KGB minders.

29
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,270
Lovely girl with the cello.

30
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,950
Forget the ladies for once, Bond.

31
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,992
Koskov will leave here at the interval.

32
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,196
We'd better go.

33
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,236
Turn off the lights.

34
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,074
Now, let's understand one another, Bond.
General Koskov is a top KGB mastermind.

35
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,953
His defection is my baby.
He contacted me.

36
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,548
I've planned this out to the last detail.

37
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,676
- You'll want the soft-nosed ones, I expect.
- No, the steel-tipped.

38
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,633
KGB snipers usually wear body armour.

39
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,710
- What's your escape route?
- Sorry, old man. Section 26, paragraph 5.

40
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,310
That information is on
a need-to-know basis only.

41
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,237
I'm sure you understand.

42
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,033
Koskov is under
intensive KGB surveillance.

43
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,310
A sniper has been assigned to watch him

44
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,398
and he expressly asked
for you to protect him.

45
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,756
- Why me?
- He has the impression you're the best.

46
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,158
- Where's the car?
- In the alley out the back.

47
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,316
Bring the chair.

48
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,437
It'll take him about
10 seconds to reach us.

49
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,075
Plenty of time for a sniper
to make strawberry jam of him!

50
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,590
There's Koskov now.

51
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,516
What's he waiting for?

52
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,398
Sniper. Two floors up, centre window.

53
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,671
The girl with the cello!

54
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,798
Fire, Bond, fire!

55
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,429
Shoot her! What are you waiting for?

56
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,195
You missed deliberately!

57
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,310
Where is he?

58
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,510
- In the boot.
- First place they'd look.

59
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,870
- But my escape route...
- Scrubbed.

60
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,870
Get in the front.

61
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,753
- James. James Bond!
- Later, General.

62
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,358
Lose them. I'll pick you up at the border.
2300 hours. Be there.

63
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,233
- How will you get him out?
- Sorry, old man.

64
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,717
Section 26, paragraph 5: "need-to-know".
I'm sure you understand.

65
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,995
- The sniper was a woman.
- I noticed.

66
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,189
Some of the best KGB shots are women.

67
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,919
- Did you?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

68
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,792
No, of course not.

69
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,037
They are looking for me! If they
close the border, how will I get out?

70
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,597
Don't you worry about that, Georgi.
We have a pipeline to the West.

71
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,549
- Rosika Miklos.
- Our man here.

72
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
Good to work with you again, Mr Bond.
Come.

73
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,191
Keep quiet.

74
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,311
- We must hurry. Get him in the pig.
- Pig? What is pig?

75
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,389
Scouring plug to clean out the pipeline.
This one's been designed to carry a man.

76
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,795
Pipeline? You mean our pipeline?

77
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,390
Great Soviet achievement -
piping natural gas into the West.

78
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,751
- But not me!
- Don't worry, Georgi. It's a piece of cake.

79
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,192
Never mind cake. If you open valve
before 100, he will be borsch!

80
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,632
Pigs! Borsch! Cake!
There must be another way!

81
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,718
Get in. Put on the mask
and breathe normally.

82
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,956
- Enough talk!
- Relax, Georgi.

83
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,310
Our people have spent months on this.

84
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,910
- How many times have you done this?
- You're the first.

85
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,714
Remember. When this says 100,
turn this. Not before.

86
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,599
- Where are you going?
- To take care of the supervisor.

87
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,838
When pig goes, his control panel
will light up like Christmas tree.

88
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,552
What kind of girl do you think I am!

89
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,156
Welcome to Austria, General.

90
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,556
Come on. Up you go.

91
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,396
Come on, hurry up!

92
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,470
That's right. We've got him.

93
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,236
Excuse me. Shut it now.

94
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,236
Thank you.

95
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,832
Cheer up, Saunders.
The operation's a success.

96
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,549
- And officially still yours.
- I don't intend to leave it at that, 007.

97
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,438
I'm telling M you deliberately missed.
Your orders were to kill that sniper.

98
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,189
Stuff my orders. I only kill professionals.

99
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,437
That girl didn't know
one end of a rifle from the other.

100
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,348
Go ahead. Tell M what you want.
If he fires me, I'll thank him for it.

101
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,468
Whoever she was, I must have
scared the living daylights out of her.

102
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,469
Russian general defects!

103
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,719
Ula Yarkhov. Confirmed kills, three.
Probable kills, two.

104
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,516
Assassination methods:
Strangulation with hands or thighs.

105
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,596
James, she's just your type!

106
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,915
Wrong again, Moneypenny. You are.

107
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,793
I'll file that
with the other secret information.

108
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,594
Specialist-child impersonations.

109
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,713
Assassination method:
Explosive teddy bears.

110
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,195
That's all the KGB female assassins.

111
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,598
You know, we could try freelancers
stationed outside the Soviet bloc.

112
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,395
It'll have to wait. M wants you
out at the Blayden safe house.

113
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,273
Right. Looks like
it's a dead end here anyway.

114
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,353
Ah! Good!

115
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,151
Something we're making for
the Americans. It's called a ghetto blaster.

116
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,756
You'd better hurry. M wants you
to stop at Harrods and pick up a parcel.

117
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,795
Moneypenny, ask Records to monitor
Czech publication and news services

118
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,118
for any mention of a woman cellist
at the conservatoire in Bratislava.

119
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,239
I didn't know
you were such a music lover, James.

120
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,592
Any time you want to drop by and
listen to my Barry Manilow collection...

121
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,073
- Sorry, sir. Excuse me.
- Bloody Yanks.

122
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,316
Good morning, sir.

123
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,390
Control here. 007's on his way.

124
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,599
Sorry, Mr Bond.
You'll have to leave the metal.

125
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,639
Thank you, sir.

126
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,672
- Good morning, sir. May I help you?
- No, thanks.

127
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,756
They're in the drawing room.

128
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,879
Come.

129
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,232
James!

130
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,750
James, I will never forget
what you did for me!

131
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,396
Thank you so... What's this?

132
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,635
From Harrods. A godsend!
The food here is horrible.

133
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,593
- The foie gras is excellent.
- Da, da. As Russians say,

134
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,269
hearts and stomachs
good comrades make.

135
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,155
What's this? Caviar. Well, that's peasant
food for us, but with champagne it's OK.

136
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,078
Bollinger RD. The best!

137
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,275
The brand on the list was questionable,
sir, so I chose something else.

138
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,311
Superb, Mr Bond!

139
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,830
May I suggest we resume the debriefing?

140
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,190
Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm all yours.

141
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,314
- Where's the usual milkman?
- What d'you say?

142
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,318
- Where's the usual man?
- Flu.

143
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,677
- Hey, mate. Watch it!
- Kitchen entrance, round the back.

144
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,999
General Leonid Pushkin is why I defect.

145
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,430
What? Your KGB superior?

146
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,677
Gogol's replacement when
he joined their foreign service.

147
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,509
Once we were like brothers,
but now he's a different man.

148
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,632
Power has gone to his head.
He's sick, like Stalin!

149
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,433
He hates our new policy of détente.

150
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,794
I have here a secret directive
from Pushkin. Smiert Spionom.

151
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,355
"Death to Spies", Minister.

152
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,555
For an assassination programme, with list
of targets - British and American agents.

153
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,233
When this starts, you will retaliate.

154
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,830
Soviet and Western Intelligence
could destroy each other.

155
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,951
This might lead to nuclear war!

156
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,231
Unless Pushkin can be...
How do you say?

157
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,396
Put away.

158
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,793
Where is Pushkin now? In Moscow?

159
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,992
But in three days
he will leave for Tangier.

160
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,954
Cover - North African trade convention.

161
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,916
Real reason?

162
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,996
New directive.

163
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,755
Minister, in view of the importance
of what Mr Koskov has just told us,

164
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,678
I believe we should
consult with higher authority.

165
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,759
- By all means. Good day, Mr Koskov.
- Good day, sir.

166
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,030
There you go. There's a good lad.

167
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,637
- Good morning.
- Morning. Put it down there, would you?

168
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,318
Ta.

169
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,313
Green Four to base!

170
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,633
Green Four, this is control.
Where are you?

171
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,916
You may have a malfunction.

172
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,718
Green Four to base.
We have gas leaks in main building.

173
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,356
Some personnel overcome. Evacuate.
Send for emergency medical services.

174
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,831
Green Four, I read and understand you.

175
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,839
Control to all stations.
Code 10. Initiate emergency drill.

176
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,919
Evacuate the main building.
Emergency. Emergency.

177
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,151
Green Four to base. Major gas explosion.
Keep clear of the main building.

178
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,112
KGB!

179
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,789
Keep back!

180
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,997
- Get up. Come on!
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

181
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,230
Move. Move!

182
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,991
Keep clear of the main building.

183
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,756
- Who's that for?
- You, comrade.

184
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,552
Help him or I kill you both.

185
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,596
Move! Hurry.

186
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,395
Only emergency services
should be allowed in the area.

187
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,996
Stay away from the house.

188
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,068
Please don't use
your private radiophones.

189
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,917
Two dead, two in hospital, and Koskov
probably back in Moscow, if not dead.

190
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,077
We're the laughing stock
of the Intelligence community.

191
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,320
Our first major coup in years, snatched
from right under our noses by the KGB

192
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,396
only hours after he defected!

193
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,476
- No trace of him?
- Nothing.

194
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,593
- Then there's this Pushkin matter.
- Well, I must be off.

195
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,915
Meeting with the PM this afternoon.

196
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,434
We have to nip
Smiert Spionom in the bud.

197
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,317
Pushkin should be in Tangiers
in two days' time.

198
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,874
A termination warrant
has been issued for him.

199
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,595
This plot to kill agents
sounds rather far-fetched, sir.

200
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,755
- I know General Pushkin.
- Do you think I don't?

201
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,678
I've dealt with him on several occasions!

202
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,954
Our paths have crossed over the years.
He's tough and resourceful, but...

203
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,153
- I can't believe he's a psychotic.
- Neither did I until today.

204
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,875
This arrived from Gibraltar.
It was found near 004's body.

205
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,274
Your name was on Pushkin's list, too, 007.

206
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,319
There are a few things I'd like to check
out first, sir. That sniper, for instance.

207
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,035
Yes. I've read Saunders' report.
You jeopardised the mission

208
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,792
- To avoid shooting a beautiful girl.
- I had to make a split-second decision.

209
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,480
- It was instinct.
- I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong.

210
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,909
He can do it. He doesn't know Pushkin.

211
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,112
He follows orders, not instincts.

212
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,239
- You can take a fortnight's leave.
- No!

213
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,716
Sir.

214
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,311
If it has to be done, I'd rather do it.

215
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,999
Right, bring it down slowly. Gently now.

216
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,873
- Morning, Q.
- Ah, morning, 007.

217
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,150
Mind your head.

218
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,829
I've got something for you.
We're just winterising this.

219
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,994
Now, pay attention, 007.

220
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,475
A key-ring finder.

221
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,315
- Surprise me.
- You arm it by pressing that button there.

222
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,317
Like that. See?

223
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,836
Right. Now wear that.

224
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,990
Right. Now whistle
the first bars of "Rule, Britannia".

225
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,759
Stun gas. Effective range?
Ooh, about five feet.

226
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,513
Disorientates any normal person
for about, ooh, 30 seconds.

227
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,235
You don't find too many
normal people in this business, Q.

228
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,113
What is it to blow up the room -
"God Save the Queen"?

229
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,950
It so happens, 007, that we've packed
the finder with concentrated explosive,

230
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,389
sufficient to remove the door of any safe.

231
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,798
It's magnetic.
The actuating signal is personalised.

232
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,309
- What's my code?
- Oh, most appropriate.

233
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,319
- A wolf whistle.
- You mean, um...

234
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,316
Stop!

235
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,710
You may find the keys useful.

236
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,069
They open 90% of the world's locks.

237
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,837
All right, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

238
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,079
- Well done, Moneypenny. That's her.
- Records sent over this translation.

239
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,760
"Kara Milovy,
talented scholarship cellist,

240
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,350
whose arm was injured
during an intermission last week,

241
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,516
will be at the academy on Thursday,

242
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,552
playing Borodin's
'String Quartet No.2 in D'."

243
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,274
That's tomorrow.

244
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,758
Moneypenny, I'll need travel documents
for Tangier via Bratislava.

245
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,269
And keep this between ourselves.

246
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,709
That girl must be very talented.

247
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,674
Believe me, my interest in her
is purely professional.

248
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,918
- Just taking the Aston Martin for a spin.
- Be careful, 007.

249
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,031
It's just had a new coat of paint!

250
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,035
I dropped the gun in the river.

251
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,955
The KGB made quite a mess.

252
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,035
You're English. Who are you?

253
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,430
I heard you play
at the conservatoire yesterday.

254
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,794
It was exquisite.

255
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,675
I saw what happened on the tram.
Where did they take you?

256
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,156
KGB headquarters?

257
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,716
They released me this morning.

258
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,308
Take a look across the street.

259
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,478
They let you go so they could follow you.

260
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,510
I don't understand.
Why are you trying to help me?

261
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,999
What did Pushkin want?

262
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,351
Did he ask you about Georgi Koskov?

263
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,676
He wanted to know where he was.

264
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,758
- Did you tell him?
- No.

265
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
That was clever of Georgi, using blanks.

266
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,550
Made the British believe
his defection was real.

267
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,796
How do you know that?

268
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,195
He told me.

269
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,471
- You saw him?
- Two days ago. He's safe and sound.

270
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,839
- You're a friend of his?
- We've been through quite a lot together.

271
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,918
Dear Georgi!
He kept his promise to send for me.

272
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,952
Where are we going? To London?

273
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,676
No, not yet. The British think
he'll be safer if he keeps moving around.

274
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,076
- We might catch up with him in Vienna.
- Vienna?

275
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,829
We must leave immediately,
before they pick you up again.

276
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,916
- But how?
- We'll manage.

277
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,315
Get packed. Bring some warm clothes.

278
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,115
Looks like we got away with it.

279
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,914
My cello! It's at the conservatoire.

280
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,157
- I'll get you another in Vienna.
- No, we must go back for it.

281
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,556
We have 10 minutes before
they discover what's happened.

282
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,433
- I must get my cello.
- No way!

283
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,036
Come on, get in!

284
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,750
Why didn't you learn the violin?

285
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,550
You've picked up the police band.

286
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,114
There must be an atmospheric anomaly.

287
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,109
They're looking for a foreign car.
A man and a woman.

288
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,878
And a cello!

289
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,839
Looks like they just found us.

290
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,274
Pull over to the side and stop!

291
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,834
- What happened?
- Salt corrosion.

292
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,876
They're setting up roadblocks.

293
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,632
- What is this?
- I've had a few optional extras installed.

294
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,355
Amazing, this modern safety glass.

295
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,989
Look out!

296
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,791
See where this leads to.

297
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,636
This road only leads to the lake.

298
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,836
Time to leave.

299
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,473
James!

300
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,552
Brace yourself.

301
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,755
We almost made it.

302
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,636
Come on, quick! Go!

303
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,754
Glad I insisted you brought that cello!

304
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,398
Sorry!

305
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,832
Not far now!

306
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,750
Here, wave this.

307
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,756
Duck!

308
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,236
- We've nothing to declare!
- Just a cello!

309
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,434
TANGIER

310
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,958
If you wait here, sir, I'll find the chief.

311
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,749
General Pushkin, it's a pleasure.

312
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,236
I'm Brad Whitaker.
Didn't expect to see you in Tangiers.

313
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,635
General Koskov with you?

314
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,591
War. War has always been
man's main occupation.

315
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,554
Fools say his greatest accomplishments
were the wheel and the alphabet.

316
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,910
I say it's a battering ram and gunpowder.

317
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,713
How do you like my pantheon
of great commanders?

318
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,877
- Butchers.
- Surgeons.

319
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,959
They cut away society's dead flesh.
Let me show you something.

320
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,116
At ease, Sergeant. This way, sir.

321
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,311
My hobby-the strategy and tactics
of the world's historic battles.

322
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,317
Afghanistan,
the North-West Frontier, 1895.

323
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,432
The initial trial of the first
automatic machine gun.

324
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,676
The.303-calibre Maxim.

325
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,110
The King's Royal Rifles
wiped out a vastly superior force.

326
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,357
Kept the British in Afghanistan
for another 25 years.

327
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,439
What you Russians need nowadays
is the equivalent of a modern Maxim.

328
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,436
Third-generation starlight scope.

329
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,997
A laser-sighting, short-barrelled
machine pistol. Infantry mini-missiles.

330
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,635
Range - 5km.
And smart. Just fire and forget.

331
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,354
It penetrates all existing armour.

332
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,914
Yes, sir! Samples of everything ordered.

333
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,474
The order is cancelled.

334
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,275
You'll return our deposit
of $50 million within the next 48 hours.

335
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,356
You can't be serious, General.

336
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,233
Do you know how hard it is
to obtain this equipment?

337
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,669
This is the latest US and European stuff.

338
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,190
I've made commitments,
letters of credit, special payoffs.

339
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,279
We know that you've had our money
in your Swiss account for eight weeks

340
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,914
and that you have made
no payments of any kind.

341
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,679
Look, I can't cancel
orders at this late date.

342
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,712
As one soldier to another,
you have my word of honour...

343
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,675
Spare me your military pretensions.
What army did you serve in?

344
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,633
You were expelled
from West Point for cheating.

345
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,517
Then a short stint as
a mercenary in the Belgian Congo.

346
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,997
Later you worked with various criminals
to help finance your first arms deals.

347
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,953
Lies spread by my competitors.

348
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,992
You forget your many
so-called wars of liberation

349
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,113
that I have supplied through General
Koskov. Those are my credentials.

350
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,189
The money in two days, or you'll find
yourself out of business permanently.

351
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,675
Georgi Koskov as well.

352
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,233
I don't know what you two are scheming,

353
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,511
but it is over. Is that understood?

354
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,516
Careful.

355
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,119
Taxi!

356
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,112
Vienna's beautiful, just like Georgi said.

357
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,994
- You care for him a great deal, don't you?
- I owe him everything.

358
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,033
My scholarship
at the conservatoire, my Strad.

359
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,756
- Your cello's a Stradivarius?
- A famous one. The Lady Rose.

360
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,599
- Georgi got it in New York.
- Quite a present.

361
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,550
Maybe someday I'll play there.
At Carnegie Hall?

362
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,150
- Georgi believes I can do it.
- I'm sure he's right.

363
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,716
- We go to him now?
- Yeah. Unless he had to move on.

364
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,554
If he did, I'm sure he left a message.

365
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,916
- Careful.
- Careful.

366
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,997
Good afternoon, Mr Bond.

367
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,556
- You will need your usual suite?
- Not tonight, Hans.

368
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,636
- We need a second bedroom.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,196
- Shall I have vodka martinis sent up?
- Shaken, not stirred.

370
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,276
Of course.

371
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,229
Universal Exports.

372
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,229
Bond here. I need two tickets for the
opera tonight, to be left at the box office.

373
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,994
- Do you like it?
- For princess or wife of commissar?

374
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,429
- Let's buy it.
- Don't joke!

375
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,552
- Who will pay?
- Georgi, of course.

376
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,356
The chief wants you.

377
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,756
We have to report.

378
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,870
Very good. At ease, Sergeant.

379
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,476
Pushkin wants the money back.

380
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,588
Don't worry. We've convinced
the British that Pushkin is a danger.

381
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,713
They will send their best man,
James Bond, to eliminate him.

382
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,513
I'm not convinced. Necros can do it.

383
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,474
I've worked with the Russians.
My appearance is well known to them.

384
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,831
It could jeopardise my comrades
who depend upon me.

385
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,238
And they depend upon me. Where else
will they find a supply of arms?

386
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,351
Our basic plan is sound.

387
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,233
Pushkin is, how you say, history.

388
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,033
Not yet. James Bond
hasn't laid a finger on him.

389
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,151
- The British are cautious.
- Yeah.

390
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,352
An additional inducement will ensure this.

391
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,189
For instance,
if another agent were eliminated.

392
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,279
Do it. But if Pushkin is alive on
the last day of the conference, kill him!

393
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,877
- All my life I've dreamed of this.
- You might play here one day.

394
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,959
That's too much to hope for.
Excuse me for a few moments.

395
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,831
- Is that?
- The cello girl.

396
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,077
- The KGB sniper? Why bring her here?
- She's not a KGB sniper.

397
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,998
She's Koskov's girlfriend.

398
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,078
She shot blanks to make
his defection look real to us.

399
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,272
Koskov's defection phoney?
The KGB snatched him back.

400
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,960
That's what we were supposed to think.

401
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,631
These are serious accusations, Bond.
What are you up to?

402
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,639
I'm posing as Koskov's friend
to see what leads I can get from her.

403
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,673
You know he bought her a cello
in New York called the Lady Rose?

404
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,554
- A cello with a name?
- It's a Stradivarius.

405
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,796
They all have names.

406
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,514
Where would Koskov
get the money? Check it out.

407
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,033
I'll need papers for her tonight. I have
to get her out of the country by tomorrow.

408
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,958
Here. I took these this afternoon.

409
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,029
Look, this is highly irregular.
I won't get the OK from London today.

410
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,632
It can't wait, Saunders. That girl's
our only chance of getting Koskov back.

411
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,112
Very well.
I've got nothing to lose but my pension.

412
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,519
Meet me at the Prater Café
near the Ferris wheel at midnight.

413
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,435
- No more.
- This one!

414
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,997
Take me on the wheel.

415
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,795
You'll be able to see better.

416
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,993
Is it real or just a dream?

417
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,030
What's wrong? Why do we stop?

418
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,076
I arranged it.

419
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,156
We could be here all night.

420
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,193
Don't.

421
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,470
It's impossible.

422
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,196
Knowing you only two days and all I can
think of is how we would be together.

423
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,477
Don't think.

424
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,556
Just let it happen.

425
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,355
Do you want another ride?

426
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,829
I'll be back in a minute.
There may be a message for me.

427
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,869
It was bought recently
at auction in New York.

428
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,199
Lot 124, the Lady Rose,
a cello by Stradivarius of Cremona, 1724.

429
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,993
Sold for $150,000

430
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,231
to Brad Whitaker.

431
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,555
Whitaker? The arms dealer?

432
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,636
The same.

433
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,396
Koskov and Whitaker.

434
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,752
- Where's Whitaker now?
- At his place in Tangier.

435
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,876
Well done.

436
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,996
Good luck.

437
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,753
Saunders.

438
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,437
Thanks.

439
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,596
Where are you going?

440
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,796
What's the matter?

441
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,360
Bad accident back there.

442
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,199
Did you hear?

443
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,276
Hear from Georgi?

444
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,796
Yes.

445
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,470
I got the message.

446
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,835
He's with Whitaker in Tangier.

447
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,872
Brad Whitaker? The American?

448
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,434
- You know him?
- He's a patron of the arts.

449
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,438
Georgi said he'd help me.

450
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,915
How soon do we have to go?

451
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,639
Immediately. I promised Georgi
I'd get you back as soon as I could.

452
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,830
Can't we stay here a few days?

453
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,428
No. We leave first thing in the morning.

454
01:06:57,088 --> 01:06:59,044
Is anything wrong?

455
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,725
- Bond!
- Don't make any sudden moves, General.

456
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:07,564
Go to the table.

457
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:27,524
Sit down.

458
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:40,360
I take it that this is not a social call, 007.

459
01:07:40,488 --> 01:07:43,446
Correct. You should have brought lilies.

460
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:48,927
- May I ask why?
- Smiert Spionom.

461
01:07:52,008 --> 01:07:56,957
That was a Beria operation in Stalin's
time. It was deactivated 20 years ago.

462
01:07:57,088 --> 01:08:00,239
- Two of our agents are dead.
- My condolences.

463
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,359
We had nothing to do with it.

464
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:09,445
Where's Koskov?

465
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:13,686
He disappeared two weeks ago.
I was about to have him arrested.

466
01:08:13,808 --> 01:08:17,118
- Why?
- For misusing state funds.

467
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:19,485
Involving Whitaker?

468
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:22,520
That is a security matter
and cannot be discussed.

469
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,843
That was damn stupid!

470
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,236
Get in the bathroom and lock the door.

471
01:08:52,848 --> 01:08:54,804
Stay where you are!

472
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,844
Get down on your knees.

473
01:09:02,608 --> 01:09:04,564
Put your hands behind your back.

474
01:09:06,848 --> 01:09:10,557
You are professional.
You do not kill without reason.

475
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,327
Two of our men are dead.
Koskov's named you.

476
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:19,163
- Now, why should I disobey my orders?
- I am in the dark as much as you are.

477
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:23,076
It is a question of trust.
Who do you believe?

478
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,403
Koskov or me?

479
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,679
If I trusted Koskov,
we wouldn't be talking.

480
01:09:30,528 --> 01:09:35,044
But as long as you're alive,
we'll never know what he's up to.

481
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:43,086
Then I must die.

482
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,601
Ladies and gentlemen,

483
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:49,357
it is my honour to introduce
the head of the Russian delegation,

484
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:51,444
Comrade Leonid Pushkin.

485
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:04,046
Comrade delegates,

486
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:09,162
I bring you profound fraternal greetings
from your comrades in Soviet Union.

487
01:10:35,368 --> 01:10:37,006
Seal the building!

488
01:11:57,088 --> 01:12:00,842
- You looking for a party?
- Seems like a good idea.

489
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:07,248
I'm sorry to put you
through that, my dear.

490
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:16,685
It is the first time I've ever been grateful
that James Bond is a good shot!

491
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:23,599
Pull over here. We can have a party
some other time. A little present for you.

492
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:29,686
Not enough? Take it all.

493
01:12:35,288 --> 01:12:38,166
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

494
01:13:01,608 --> 01:13:03,564
Down below.

495
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:11,526
What the hell are you trying to do, 007?
Start World War III?

496
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:15,436
Felix Leiter!
Now, what's the CIA doing here?

497
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,321
Nice work, girls.

498
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:20,281
- No hard feelings?
- Not if the party's still on.

499
01:13:23,408 --> 01:13:28,277
It's a long story, Felix, but in the end
Pushkin makes a miraculous recovery.

500
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:30,763
You mean this is a put-up job?

501
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,127
- What's all this?
- We've been watching Pushkin

502
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,239
since he met two days ago with Whitaker.

503
01:13:37,568 --> 01:13:40,878
- An illegal arms deal with the Russians?
- You've got me, James.

504
01:13:41,008 --> 01:13:45,877
Whitaker has a few samples of hi-tech
stuff, but he's placed no big orders yet.

505
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:50,684
Looks like we're working on the same
case from opposite ends. Let's talk shop.

506
01:13:53,568 --> 01:13:54,523
Well done!

507
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:57,116
Congratulations.
We heard it over the radio.

508
01:13:57,248 --> 01:13:59,887
I didn't kill him. Bond did.

509
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:03,885
I told you the British believed me!
I told you!

510
01:14:04,008 --> 01:14:05,919
I told you!

511
01:14:06,048 --> 01:14:09,404
Now we can move. I'll signal
Amsterdam to ship the diamonds.

512
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,042
- Sir?
- Hello? Yes.

513
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:15,644
Who?

514
01:14:17,128 --> 01:14:19,084
It's for you.

515
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:25,324
Hello?

516
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:52,481
Where have you been, James?
You were gone so long, I was worried!

517
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:56,920
It's always nice to be missed.
Still no sign of Georgi.

518
01:14:57,048 --> 01:14:59,004
- No, please. Go on playing.
- No.

519
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:02,884
Let's have a drink.

520
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:14,644
You remembered.

521
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:21,798
To us.

522
01:15:21,928 --> 01:15:23,884
Nazdraviye.

523
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:29,284
Did I get it right?

524
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:33,004
Perfect.

525
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:35,964
What's the matter?

526
01:15:39,808 --> 01:15:42,402
Kara, it's time I told you the truth.

527
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:48,280
I'm not a friend of Georgi's.
I'm a British agent looking for him.

528
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:53,641
He's betrayed us all, Kara.
The Russians, the British, even you.

529
01:15:55,968 --> 01:16:00,280
He told us a sniper might try to kill him.

530
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:03,559
And he set you up as the sniper, Kara.

531
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:07,044
He wants you dead. You knew too much.

532
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:10,797
Liar! You pretended to love me!

533
01:16:10,928 --> 01:16:15,922
I telephoned Whitaker.
Georgi was there. He told me the truth.

534
01:16:16,048 --> 01:16:19,404
You're a KGB agent,
using me to find him and kill him!

535
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:21,325
No, that's not...

536
01:16:21,448 --> 01:16:23,404
That's not true. I...

537
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:27,721
That's...

538
01:16:29,648 --> 01:16:31,525
Chloral hydrate!

539
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:34,526
- Keep your hands off me!
- Kara, listen to me!

540
01:16:37,488 --> 01:16:39,683
The rifle was shot out of your hands.

541
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,163
- How do you know?
- Because I was the...

542
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:45,717
I was the man sent to kill you.

543
01:16:47,128 --> 01:16:49,517
Why didn't you?

544
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:05,644
Kara, my darling,
you were absolutely perfect.

545
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:08,521
Hurry.

546
01:17:51,248 --> 01:17:53,204
Open it, please.

547
01:17:54,608 --> 01:17:57,076
Careful. It must be kept absolutely sterile.

548
01:17:58,368 --> 01:18:00,324
Urgh! Go.

549
01:18:51,368 --> 01:18:53,882
I've been such a fool.

550
01:18:55,048 --> 01:18:57,278
We both have.

551
01:18:57,408 --> 01:18:59,364
Open the lid.

552
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:01,683
Oh, my God!

553
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:04,447
That's not human. It's an animal's heart.

554
01:19:08,648 --> 01:19:11,526
Diamonds hidden in the ice.

555
01:19:15,368 --> 01:19:19,407
- How can I help you?
- I need my key ring. Look out!

556
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,683
Black coffee for our guest.

557
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:52,042
She has so many talents!

558
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:54,079
I'm curious.

559
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:57,439
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, I'm not a barbarian, James.

560
01:19:57,568 --> 01:20:00,207
I'm taking you
to the proper Soviet authorities

561
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:03,320
for the killing of General Pushkin.

562
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:11,283
You're a wonder, Georgi!
You get me to kill Pushkin for you.

563
01:20:11,408 --> 01:20:14,320
Then you turn me in
to the Russians for his murder.

564
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:17,963
What are you going to ask for? Lmmunity?

565
01:20:18,088 --> 01:20:21,763
Permission to emigrate
and enjoy the amenities of the West?

566
01:20:21,888 --> 01:20:24,766
You don't think they'll
condone your defection?

567
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:26,446
What defection?

568
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:29,685
I have been on a secret mission
for General Pushkin

569
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:33,278
to disinform British Intelligence.

570
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:37,481
I'm sorry, James.
For you I have great affection,

571
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:41,886
but we have an old saying:
"Duty has no sweethearts."

572
01:20:43,728 --> 01:20:46,765
We have an old saying, too, Georgi.

573
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:49,197
And you're full of it!

574
01:21:11,808 --> 01:21:13,764
Come, Kara.

575
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,607
- Kara?
- Yes.

576
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:34,958
Welcome to Afghanistan.

577
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:37,761
Colonel Feyador,
my old comrade in arms.

578
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:45,278
I have here General Pushkin's assassin.
British Agent 007, James Bond.

579
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:48,445
See he is sent to Moscow.

580
01:21:48,568 --> 01:21:50,843
One moment. There's one more.

581
01:21:50,968 --> 01:21:53,926
Take her, too. She's a defector.

582
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:58,199
I will be compassionate with you

583
01:21:58,328 --> 01:22:02,321
and try to have you assigned to
the Siberian Philharmonic Orchestra.

584
01:22:02,448 --> 01:22:05,838
They're quite good
despite their bourgeois repertoire.

585
01:22:13,448 --> 01:22:18,317
I am on a secret state mission. I need
a detachment of men and some trucks.

586
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,764
- What are these here for?
- For murder.

587
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:28,844
Murder?

588
01:22:29,808 --> 01:22:33,562
I haven't had a woman prisoner
for a long time!

589
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:39,556
Come.

590
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,566
Russky! Has Colonel Feyador
considered my appeal?

591
01:22:42,688 --> 01:22:44,565
Yes. Good news.

592
01:22:44,688 --> 01:22:47,885
You won't be hung in the morning.
You will be shot!

593
01:22:50,528 --> 01:22:52,803
It's all a mistake! I stole nothing!

594
01:22:52,928 --> 01:22:55,283
You can tell Allah when you see him!

595
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:01,359
- Strip!
- Nye smeyete menya trogat/

596
01:23:01,488 --> 01:23:06,608
Shout all you want. It's soundproofed.
They don't like to hear screaming at night.

597
01:23:07,888 --> 01:23:10,482
I didn't tell you to get down!

598
01:23:13,248 --> 01:23:15,557
I did not tell you to get up!

599
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:17,644
Now get up!

600
01:24:37,848 --> 01:24:40,316
Lock the door.

601
01:24:42,688 --> 01:24:45,919
You were fantastic! We're free!

602
01:24:46,048 --> 01:24:51,361
Kara, we're in a Russian air base in the
middle of Afghanistan. Try the small key.

603
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:57,364
At least we're together.

604
01:24:57,488 --> 01:24:59,444
Terrific. Come on.

605
01:25:07,288 --> 01:25:09,358
Please.

606
01:26:44,688 --> 01:26:46,838
Come on, jump!

607
01:26:59,288 --> 01:27:01,643
- What's going on?
- I tell them you no Russian.

608
01:27:01,768 --> 01:27:04,043
- They no kill you now.
- How about later?

609
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:07,683
Don't worry.
They'll save you for the harem!

610
01:27:29,128 --> 01:27:31,403
It's the work of the mujaheddin.

611
01:27:31,528 --> 01:27:33,120
Mujaheddin?

612
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,204
The Afghan Resistance.

613
01:29:09,328 --> 01:29:11,683
I hope he's not invited to dinner.

614
01:29:36,528 --> 01:29:41,238
Thank you both for your help.
My name is Kamran Shah.

615
01:29:41,368 --> 01:29:45,805
Please forgive the theatricals.
It's a hangover from my Oxford days.

616
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:47,964
I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.

617
01:29:49,888 --> 01:29:51,844
It's all right, go ahead.

618
01:30:00,648 --> 01:30:04,641
- I have to get back to the air base.
- You must be crazy!

619
01:30:04,768 --> 01:30:08,966
- Half the Russian army's looking for you!
- You won't help?

620
01:30:09,088 --> 01:30:11,443
No.

621
01:30:11,568 --> 01:30:13,798
Then put me in touch
with the mujaheddin.

622
01:30:17,968 --> 01:30:20,562
Deputy Commander
of the Eastern District.

623
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:26,718
I was caught reconnoitring the air base.
Thankfully they didn't know who I was.

624
01:30:26,848 --> 01:30:29,203
Now, who are you?

625
01:30:29,728 --> 01:30:31,958
I work for the British government.

626
01:30:34,968 --> 01:30:37,243
We've uncovered a plot
by General Koskov

627
01:30:37,368 --> 01:30:40,485
to purchase American hi-tech weapons.

628
01:30:40,608 --> 01:30:44,317
Arms that could be used
against you and your men.

629
01:30:44,448 --> 01:30:48,327
That is important. You must go to
our commander in the Khyber Pass.

630
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:53,203
That could take days. I have to get back
to the air base before Koskov leaves.

631
01:30:53,328 --> 01:30:57,162
Look, come with us tomorrow.
After our mission, I'll see what I can do.

632
01:30:57,288 --> 01:30:59,244
That'll be too late.

633
01:31:00,808 --> 01:31:03,276
- I need a gun and some guides.
- Impossible.

634
01:31:03,408 --> 01:31:06,047
I cannot spare men or the horses.

635
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:10,127
And now it is time to rest.
We leave at sunrise.

636
01:31:23,808 --> 01:31:25,764
I was worried for you, James.

637
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,164
What's going to happen to us?

638
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:37,087
Kheista.

639
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,164
What does that mean?

640
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:43,396
It means beautiful in Afghan.

641
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:50,527
We're with the mujaheddin.

642
01:31:50,648 --> 01:31:54,243
We leave with them in the morning
on some kind of operation.

643
01:31:54,368 --> 01:31:56,677
And you're going to the Khyber Pass.

644
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:59,641
You're not coming with me?

645
01:31:59,768 --> 01:32:02,999
No. I'll catch up with you later.

646
01:32:03,128 --> 01:32:05,596
You're going back for Georgi, aren't you?

647
01:32:07,008 --> 01:32:10,080
- It's too dangerous. Don't go.
- I have to.

648
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:13,245
You have to what? Get killed?

649
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:17,001
- I won't wait for you.
- Fine.

650
01:32:17,128 --> 01:32:19,961
Then I'll have Kamran
send you direct to London.

651
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:23,922
You dumb, stubborn, stupid...

652
01:32:30,288 --> 01:32:33,917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Back end of horse!

653
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,323
Are you calling me a horse's arse?

654
01:32:48,488 --> 01:32:50,558
I might never see you again.

655
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,719
You will.

656
01:32:55,848 --> 01:32:57,804
I promise.

657
01:34:40,688 --> 01:34:44,283
Raw opium. Worth half a billion
dollars on the streets of New York.

658
01:34:58,488 --> 01:35:01,798
- What are you up to? Selling dope?
- Not so loud.

659
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,597
- That's the chief of the Snow Leopards.
- Who?

660
01:35:04,728 --> 01:35:08,767
- The biggest opium dealer in the area.
- I've worked for them.

661
01:35:08,888 --> 01:35:12,403
I don't care if the Russians die
from my bullets or their opium!

662
01:35:12,528 --> 01:35:14,803
Besides, we need the money to buy arms.

663
01:35:17,408 --> 01:35:19,922
- Georgi!
- And the diamonds.

664
01:35:21,688 --> 01:35:24,839
He arranged for the Russians
to buy many hi-tech weapons.

665
01:35:24,968 --> 01:35:28,040
He's using the down payment
to buy this opium instead.

666
01:35:28,168 --> 01:35:33,242
He can turn a huge profit in days and
still provide the Russians with their arms.

667
01:35:33,368 --> 01:35:35,643
- Unless...
- Go on.

668
01:35:36,688 --> 01:35:38,406
If the opium never arrives.

669
01:35:38,528 --> 01:35:41,600
The Snow Leopard Brotherhood
are dangerous to cross.

670
01:35:41,728 --> 01:35:44,117
This is their biggest deal
since the invasion.

671
01:35:44,248 --> 01:35:46,318
You won't help?

672
01:35:48,808 --> 01:35:53,438
Perhaps. As long as nothing is done
till the Russians pay up and leave.

673
01:35:53,568 --> 01:35:56,446
Right. I'll need
some plastic explosives and a timer.

674
01:35:56,568 --> 01:35:58,524
I'll see what I can do.

675
01:37:33,088 --> 01:37:35,807
James is trapped. You must help him!

676
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:39,398
- He'll have to take his chances.
- You owe him your life!

677
01:37:39,528 --> 01:37:42,725
- There's nothing more I can do.
- Yes, there is!

678
01:37:55,288 --> 01:37:57,244
Women!

679
01:39:44,928 --> 01:39:47,362
Wait here. We'll come back for you.

680
01:40:37,488 --> 01:40:39,046
Bond!

681
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:58,162
Don't shoot! Don't destroy the plane.

682
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:43,676
Block the runway!

683
01:43:44,448 --> 01:43:45,676
The tanker!

684
01:44:53,768 --> 01:44:55,679
Where is she?

685
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:04,324
We have to stop him!

686
01:45:06,448 --> 01:45:07,403
Kara!

687
01:45:37,568 --> 01:45:39,524
James!

688
01:45:44,008 --> 01:45:45,487
James!

689
01:45:53,648 --> 01:45:56,606
Don't shoot! You'll hit the plane!

690
01:46:42,248 --> 01:46:43,806
- Kara!
- Oh, my God!

691
01:46:48,128 --> 01:46:49,607
Jump!

692
01:47:20,648 --> 01:47:22,684
Now that you're here, take over.

693
01:47:22,808 --> 01:47:26,278
- What?
- Hold this and keep it straight and level.

694
01:47:26,408 --> 01:47:28,364
- Where are you going?
- To defuse a bomb.

695
01:50:29,128 --> 01:50:30,720
No!

696
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:33,163
Please!

697
01:51:47,288 --> 01:51:50,007
- What happened?
- He got the boot.

698
01:52:45,688 --> 01:52:47,406
Take over. Hold it steady.

699
01:52:47,528 --> 01:52:49,962
- Where are you going?
- To drop a bomb.

700
01:53:57,328 --> 01:53:59,284
What's the matter?

701
01:54:00,248 --> 01:54:02,204
We're losing fuel fast!

702
01:54:12,568 --> 01:54:15,685
I just hope we can make Pakistan.

703
01:54:36,848 --> 01:54:39,567
There's no place to put down.

704
01:54:42,528 --> 01:54:44,917
Go in the back.
Get in the Jeep. Quickly!

705
01:55:00,288 --> 01:55:02,438
Fasten your seat belt!

706
01:55:14,128 --> 01:55:15,197
Hold on!

707
01:55:35,928 --> 01:55:40,001
I know a great restaurant in Karachi.
We can just make dinner!

708
01:55:52,568 --> 01:55:56,561
Whitaker's on the ground floor.
Koskov is in an upstairs bedroom.

709
01:55:56,688 --> 01:55:58,838
Guard in the pool area near you.

710
01:56:00,728 --> 01:56:02,684
Guard clear. Proceed.

711
01:56:09,168 --> 01:56:10,681
Hold it.

712
01:56:12,168 --> 01:56:14,284
He's coming back.

713
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:19,396
Go, James. Over and out.

714
01:56:19,808 --> 01:56:22,083
Well, he's in.

715
01:56:45,408 --> 01:56:49,321
Pickett's charge was up
Cemetery Ridge, not Little Round Top.

716
01:56:49,448 --> 01:56:52,724
I'm replaying the battle
as I would have fought it.

717
01:56:52,848 --> 01:56:55,362
Meade was tenacious
but he was cautious.

718
01:56:55,488 --> 01:56:58,286
He missed his chances
to crush Lee at Gettysburg.

719
01:56:58,408 --> 01:57:00,364
I've come for Koskov.

720
01:57:02,488 --> 01:57:06,561
Well, hell, you can have him!
Soon as I get my opium.

721
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,839
- Now where is it?
- Up in smoke.

722
01:57:10,928 --> 01:57:13,886
You burned up a half a billion bucks?

723
01:57:16,848 --> 01:57:19,078
That's too bad, Bond.

724
01:57:19,208 --> 01:57:23,724
You know, you could have been a live,
rich man instead of a poor, dead one.

725
01:57:23,848 --> 01:57:28,717
You're finished, Whitaker. If the Russians
don't get you, the Americans will.

726
01:57:29,008 --> 01:57:30,919
Nah.

727
01:57:31,048 --> 01:57:35,087
You know, Meade should have
taken another 35,000 casualties.

728
01:57:35,848 --> 01:57:38,123
He could have ended
the rebellion right then.

729
01:57:38,248 --> 01:57:40,159
Hell, Grant would have done it.

730
01:58:07,648 --> 01:58:10,685
Right, you've had your eight.
Now I'll have my 80!

731
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:19,721
Sorry to say your popgun is no match
for the latest body armour!

732
01:58:48,648 --> 01:58:54,439
Should have known you'd take refuge
behind that British vulture Wellington!

733
01:58:57,448 --> 01:59:02,476
You know he had to buy German
mercenaries to beat Napoleon, don't you?

734
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,884
I owed you that one, Bond.

735
01:59:30,808 --> 01:59:33,800
He met his Waterloo.

736
01:59:37,608 --> 01:59:39,360
General Pushkin!

737
01:59:40,488 --> 01:59:42,444
Thank God you're still alive!

738
01:59:45,248 --> 01:59:50,163
Whitaker has held me here for weeks.
Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!

739
01:59:52,608 --> 01:59:54,963
Georgi! Georgi!

740
01:59:58,128 --> 02:00:01,484
- Put him on the next plane to Moscow.
- Oh, thank you, General!

741
02:00:01,608 --> 02:00:03,724
Thank you so much! Thank you!

742
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:06,123
In the diplomatic bag.

743
02:00:13,328 --> 02:00:15,125
What about Kara?

744
02:00:15,248 --> 02:00:17,204
She is a defector, too.

745
02:00:18,488 --> 02:00:20,444
What shall we do about her?

746
02:01:16,208 --> 02:01:18,927
Are you going to stay in France now?

747
02:01:20,368 --> 02:01:22,962
Oh, you were marvellous!

748
02:01:24,088 --> 02:01:26,044
Will you excuse us?

749
02:01:29,928 --> 02:01:32,203
General Gogol, Miss Kara Milovy.

750
02:01:33,808 --> 02:01:38,962
Magnificent! I hope you can find time
to play in Moscow very soon.

751
02:01:39,088 --> 02:01:42,444
It's all right. General Gogol
is with their foreign service.

752
02:01:42,568 --> 02:01:47,164
He's arranged an immigration visa,
so you can come and go as you like.

753
02:01:47,288 --> 02:01:49,279
Wonderful!

754
02:01:53,208 --> 02:01:54,243
Excuse me.

755
02:01:56,408 --> 02:02:00,162
I'm sorry we missed the concert.
We had some trouble at the airport.

756
02:02:00,288 --> 02:02:05,043
I can't imagine why! General Gogol,
I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.

757
02:02:05,168 --> 02:02:07,682
- My pleasure.
- Where's James?

758
02:02:07,808 --> 02:02:12,723
- Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.
- I'll be with you shortly.

759
02:02:42,128 --> 02:02:45,359
You didn't think I'd miss
this performance, did you?

760
02:02:56,808 --> 02:02:58,036
Oh, James.

761
