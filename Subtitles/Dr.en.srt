1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,750
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:02,797
Enter the code!

3
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:05,608
And Reddington is suddenly looking
for a mysterious blood doctor

4
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,117
who's doing cutting-edge
research into gene sequencing.

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,800
- You're Raymond Reddington.
- And you're in my debt.

6
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:12,725
The plan is already in motion.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,593
Men are coming, Elizabeth.

8
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,330
Men who kill every living
thing who gets in their way.

9
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:21,939
Tell Harold and then you
get out of that hospital.

10

11
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:33,726
Okay, cameras up.

12
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:37,492
When you engage, you have a
4-minute window for extraction.

13
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,788
Colonel Wright ordered a dialysis.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,224
Can't let you in without a scan.

15
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:46,859
Okay, Viktor, someone's coming.

16
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,997
Can I help you?

17
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,173
Four minutes and counting.

18
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,877
Is it true? The DNA test?
You're not Kirk's daughter.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,351
Tell your team to expect
a full military assault.

20
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:08,380
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:09,882
I just got off the
phone with Reddington.

22
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:12,818
He has reason to believe Kirk's
men are coming to break him out.

23
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:14,558
Call it off.

24
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:16,655
You talked to Reddington.

25
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:18,838
He's the only one who gets
you worked up like this.

26
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,948
If you try to escape,
innocent people will die.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,180
Secure area on the left.

28
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,551
Incendiaries are live.

29
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:57,229
Even if you could get out,
what's the point? You are sick.

30
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,631
You can help me, Masha.

31
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,599
I know you don't wanna believe this,

32
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,002
- but those test results...
- They were altered by Reddington.

33
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:06,372
No, they're real. I'm not your daughter.

34
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,941
Reddington wants me dead, Masha.

35
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:11,103
- He always has.
- Maybe. I don't know.

36
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,247
But I do know that I can't save your
life. And you aren't going anywhere.

37
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,252
You're wrong. We're leaving
here together, solnishko.

38
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:21,654
No arguments.

39
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,253
- May I have
- Agent Keen.

40
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,259
... your attention, please?

41
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,896
There has been a fire emergency
reported in the building.

42
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,437
- Our people are inside.
- Copy that.

43
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:42,408
May I have your attention,
please? There has been...

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,810
We believe the fire's a false
flag to help Kirk break out.

45
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,279
Tell your people no one in or out
of this room until I say otherwise.

46
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:50,215
- What's hospital protocol?
- Evacuation and/or containment.

47
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,074
This ward is specifically designed
to go into emergency lockdown.

48
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,286
Has anyone seen Tom?

49
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:56,088
Come on, man. Let me
in. My wife's in there.

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,457
- Can't do it.
- You know me.

51
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,725
I've been in and out all day. I
just went to get a cup of coffee.

52
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,487
Sorry, we have orders.

53
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,764
Well, you're letting
these guys in, right?

54
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:11,036
May I have your attention,
please? There has been...

55
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,354
- Doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't?

56
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,510
Why start a fire? It only
initiates hospital protocol,

57
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,009
making it even harder to get inside.

58
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,346
- Reddington.
- You're still at the hospital.

59
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:22,314
I told you, you need to get out now.

60
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,190
They're already inside.

61
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,762
Blow it. Now. Go.

62
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,668
Get down!

64
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,766
Ready? One, two, three.

65
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:23,137
- Move, move, down!
- Out, out. Come on!

66
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,934
Go!

67
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,718
Get Kirk out.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,294
Go now.

69
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,373
- Drop your weapon. Put it down.
- You put it down.

70
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:45,653
Drop...

71
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:49,075
Leave him. We're only here for Masha.

72
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,273
- Liz!
- Tom!

73
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,940
- Liz.
- Tom!

74
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,778
She cannot hear you, my friend!

75
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:05,075
Are you saying something?

76
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,719
I still cannot hear you!

77
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,468
Keep moving, keep moving.

78
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:21,772
Inside. Go, go, go. Go.

79
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,170
Leave him. Go now.

80
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,919
Hey, hey. Give me the
keys. Give me the keys.

81
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:39,393
Sorry.

82
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:48,990
You've told me you've always wanted a...

83
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:53,240
pristine, unspoiled place to
live out your days in peace.

84
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,387
So the acre is yours for all eternity.

85
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,326
Raymond.

86
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:02,240
Fever broke.

87
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,576
Think we beat that infection.

88
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,162
So, who's Raymond?

89
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,903
He the one that shot
you? Or the other guy?

90
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,314
Which one?

91
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:30,802
I don't know why you're
protecting these people.

92
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,810
Truth is, I don't care.

93
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,096
You're not leaving me a lot
of options here, sweetheart.

94
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,904
Can't hold you prisoner forever.

95
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,934
So let me go.

96
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,099
This here is a squat.

97
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,605
Public land.

98
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,207
Rangers would run me off if they knew.

99
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,779
Nobody knows I'm here but you.

100
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,113
You don't trust me.

101
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,350
So how am I supposed to
trust you with my whole world?

102
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,380
This would've been a whole lot easier

103
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:09,060
if you had been considerate
enough to die on your own.

104
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,125
We're 10 minutes out.
You got eyes on Kirk?

105
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,851
Aram's trying to locate
the escape vehicle.

106
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,587
- Where are you on Dr. Shaw?
- Nowhere. Reddington got to her.

107
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,522
If we're right and Shaw
knows how to cure Kirk,

108
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,624
Reddington has just made sure
that's not going to happen.

109
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,460
Which means Liz is his only hope.

110
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,417
Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as
he needs her stem cells to survive.

111
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:48,893
But he doesn't. The hospital ran
DNA tests. They're not related.

112
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,806
It was Kirk's men at the hospital.

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,990
- Did Elizabeth get out?
- She was taken by Kirk.

114
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,632
Well, she'll be safe with him

115
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:02,937
until Kirk's doctors confirm
she's not his daughter,

116
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:04,215
but we don't have much time.

117
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,318
We need to find patient
zero. How long, Dr. Shaw?

118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,720
It might help if I knew what
you needed the patient for.

119
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,822
My agenda has no bearing on your task.

120
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,091
You know what you're
looking for. I need it now.

121
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,394
I've treated hundreds of
patients over the years.

122
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,795
This is going to take some time.

123
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,298
I'm out of time, Doctor,
which means you're out of time.

124
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,798
Find the patient.

125
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,876
You're angry, and I accept that.

126
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,444
Tom better not be dead.

127
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:37,014
In time, you'll understand I did
this to hold my family together.

128
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,682
He better not be dead.

129
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,883
The test... Reddington falsified it.

130
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,251
He'll do anything to keep us apart.

131
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,902
We're approaching the switch site.
Medical teams are prepped and waiting.

132
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,861
Tom Keen, make sure he's not hurt.

133
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,798
- I'm not giving you my blood.
- You will help me, Masha,

134
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,247
one way or another.

135
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,151
- Agent Mojtabai.
- Aram! I'm following Liz.

136
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,420
She's in an ambulance
heading north on Bristoll.

137
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,025
Hang on!

138
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,216
- Aram, the ambulance.
- I'm tracking it now.

139
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:30,100
Agents Ressler and Navabi
are closing in from the west.

140
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,802
I'm vectoring you in.

141
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,357
- Why are we slowing?
- You can't stop

142
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:37,541
You need to get to the switch car.

143
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,609
Hold on.

144
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,297
Everybody out!

145
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,815
Let's go!

146
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,231
Out!

147
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,266
Get out of the way!

148
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,460
Hey. How's it going under there?

149
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:22,514
My boss ordered me not to kill you,

150
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,609
but he didn't say anything about
messing up that pretty face.

151
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,511
- Whoo!
- Okay, okay, okay.

152
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:40,677
You owe me.

153
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,255
What are you doing?

154
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,489
Can't keep you.

155
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,985
Can't kill you.

156
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,622
I was gonna cut you loose and...

157
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,245
pray you don't tell anybody I'm up here.

158
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:19,224
You could've left me in the woods.

159
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,286
No, I couldn't do that.

160
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,814
Police found the sedan abandoned
under a bridge about a mile away.

161
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:43,689
- Where is this place?
- That bridge was well chosen.

162
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,947
No surveillance cameras,
a complete dead zone.

163
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,548
You had a switch vehicle stashed there.

164
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,216
You were supposed to be in it.

165
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:50,838
We need a make and tag number.

166
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,095
Where were they headed?

167
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,914
Prisoners are legally
guaranteed medical care.

168
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,257
And... I've been shot.

169
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,826
- You were treated by paramedics.
- I need a doctor.

170
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:02,129
You are showing deliberate
indifference to my injuries,

171
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,931
and that is against the law.

172
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,299
Hmm.

173
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:09,642
So... this where the bullet went in?

174
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,777
This building doesn't exist.

175
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,279
That means you're not
here and you never were.

176
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,329
Where is Alexander Kirk?

177
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,988
They had a van waiting under the bridge.

178
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,990
A silver panel van.

179
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,925
The safe house was 10 minutes away,

180
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,795
but they hadn't told me where
in case of something like this.

181
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,064
I don't believe you. You're lying.

182
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,932
- I'm not!
- Tell me.

183
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,989
I don't...

184
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:44,071
know... where.

185
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,079
Keen was taken from the drop
site in a silver panel van.

186
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,914
Safe house is less than 10 minutes away.

187
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,282
Contact Montgomery County Police.

188
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,690
Tell them to pull all surveillance
from in and around that area...

189
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,243
local businesses, traffic cams.

190
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,954
I'll start a search for
properties in the area

191
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,756
associated with Kirk
or his shell companies.

192
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:05,392
Knock on doors,
interview street vendors.

193
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:07,260
Talk to anyone who
might've seen that van.

194
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,135
Let's find Agent Keen.

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,999
- I talked to Ressler.
- Tell me everything.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,414
They think they've nailed a location

197
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,568
where she's being held,
somewhere in Silver Spring.

198
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,304
- I think I found something.
- Hey. Hello, did you hear me?

199
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:19,272
I need to find her,
and I need your help.

200
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:21,041
No. The FBI needs to find her.

201
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:24,077
We need to focus on keeping
Elizabeth alive once they do.

202
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,412
What are you talking about?

203
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,514
I'll call you on this
number when I know more.

204
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,156
I found patient zero.

205
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,609
Call Baz. Tell him to get
Dr. Reifler here right away.

206
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,944
Go on.

207
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,213
Mr. Reddington, I was
on the verge of patenting

208
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,516
cutting-edge research that
would've saved countless lives.

209
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,718
I had to restore my
credentials as a doctor,

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,488
and thanks to you,
I've lost it all again.

211
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,174
Patient zero. I need a name.

212
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:50,828
I want you to bankroll my
work. I want my future back.

213
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,765
My research is illegal, not immoral.

214
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,000
A distinction I'm comfortable drawing.

215
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,037
But human experimentation
in the hull of a ship

216
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,040
is a bit too Draconian even for me.

217
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,109
I need your word that
you will not kill her.

218
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,342
Her name.

219
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,498
The HLA proteins aren't a match.

220
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,365
We're not meeting the criteria.

221
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:16,287
- You're a liar.
- I've reviewed the results three times.

222
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:18,529
How much did he pay you?

223
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,794
How much did he pay you?

224
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,372
Sir, please.

225
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,232
It... it's not a match.

226
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:35,895
You look into my eyes and you tell
me Elizabeth Keen is not my daughter.

227
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,200
She's not.

228
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,421
Dr. Reifler, I don't know about you,

229
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,573
but I'm experiencing the
strongest sense of déjà vu.

230
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,994
Why are you doing this? I've told
you everything I know about Kirk,

231
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,729
and I have been locked
in a sweaty motel room

232
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,398
- with your goons for weeks.
- Goons. That... that's not fair.

233
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,333
Well, Carlton is a bit goonish,

234
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,168
but Matthew is actually quite erudite

235
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,638
and a world-class chess player to boot.

236
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,007
In any case, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

237
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,510
Dr. Adrian Shaw, meet
Dr. Sebastian Reifler.

238
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,612
Dr. Reifler is a hematologist.

239
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,815
Dr. Shaw is a research scientist
who worked with a patient

240
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,437
you also treated, Lucille Bockes.

241
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,428
Lucille Bockes is dead.

242
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,655
Actually, she's not.

243
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,357
No, I-I put her into hospice
care over four years ago.

244
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,127
I won't pretend to
understand how it all works,

245
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,197
but I must say, Dr. Shaw
really is something of a wizard.

246
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,500
Lucille responded to my treatment

247
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,068
and went into full remission.

248
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,936
It's... it's not possible.

249
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,406
Lucille Bockes is alive and well...

250
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,850
and working as a prosecuting attorney.

251
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,376
It's Kirk.

252
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:53,827
Constantin.

253
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,119
She's not my daughter.

254
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,888
No, she's not.

255
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,356
And yet, she's here.

256
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,890
She's nothing to you. A
distant, confused memory.

257
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,261
I'm the one you want.

258
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:07,265
What I want is to put a bullet
in your head before I die.

259
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,801
Then do that. An even trade.

260
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,705
With the FBI wanting to ambush
me the moment I give her up,

261
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,073
I don't think so.

262
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,642
You set the terms. However
you want, I'll do it.

263
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,610
My life for hers.

264
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,148
Rollins Park. 20 minutes.

265
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,050
I'll send a car.

266
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,489
We can find her.

267
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,559
There's no more time.

268
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,747
He'll kill you, no
matter what you do or say.

269
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,797
You can't go.

270
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,371
It's Elizabeth.

271
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:01,001
If we can get the woman...

272
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,126
It's too late for her to save Elizabeth.

273
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,188
But perhaps she can save you.

274
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,196
Forgive me.

275
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,329
For Kate.

276
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,977
For everything.

277
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,789
The man you saw in the
picture was my employer.

278
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,895
He lost his way.

279
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:31,097
At least, that's how I saw it.

280
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:37,437
He placed a lovely young woman and
her baby girl in terrible danger...

281
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,937
not deliberately, mind
you. He loves them deeply.

282
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,803
Enough to blind him to the reality

283
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:47,609
that his very presence in their
lives constitutes a threat.

284
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:52,411
Not just to them, but
to himself as well.

285
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,455
I tried to help her.

286
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:59,593
All I managed to do was to place her
and the child in even greater danger.

287
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:02,726
My efforts earned me
a bullet in the head.

288
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:07,633
This man, he is very dangerous

289
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,869
and absolutely relentless.

290
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:12,601
If he even suspects I survived,

291
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,374
there will be no place I can be safe.

292
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,820
The reason I didn't tell you
the truth was not to protect him,

293
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:20,837
but to protect you.

294
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,421
It's a shame you have no crackers.

295
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,528
I'm not ready to die...

296
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,908
just yet.

297
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:57,418
Reddington.

298
00:19:57,585 --> 00:19:59,051
He's arriving.

299
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,841
You shouldn't have come.

300
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:24,176
The ripe apple falls.

301
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,345
Doesn't know what else to do.

302
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,382
So here I am.

303
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,217
Time to let her go.

304
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,286
I bear Masha no grudges.

305
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,875
I promise her safe passage.

306
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,853
I understand now how you see me...

307
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:45,731
dangerous man...

308
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,533
dying,

309
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:49,502
polluted by his money.

310
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:50,736
Let him go.

311
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:53,339
Love did it, if you can believe it.

312
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,041
It doesn't make much sense,

313
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:57,511
but sometimes you can feel too much,

314
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:00,206
hold on too long... it poisons you.

315
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:04,284
I should have let go
of you... years ago,

316
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,353
but you were my child.

317
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,745
I'm gonna be dead soon, and
my biggest regret is that...

318
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,293
you will remember me like this

319
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:18,331
and not the young father
who cradled you in his arms.

320
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:21,597
A lifetime in front of us.

321
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,354
You want me to remember you that way?

322
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,501
Let Reddington go.

323
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,354
Hold her for an hour.

324
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,404
Take her somewhere
remote. Leave her safe.

325
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,073
Safe, Odette.

326
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,278
I'll come for you.

327
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,546
I'll come for you.

328
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:47,282
You and I have much to talk about.

329
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,988
Excuse me, what are you doing?

330
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,690
I locked my keys in
the car, you believe it?

331
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,426
Yeah, I stopped to get
something and then... never mind.

332
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,494
- You're blocking my car.
- Yeah, I took care of it.

333
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,363
There's a locksmith...
be here in 45 minutes.

334
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,534
I'm late for court.
This can't be happening!

335
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,468
I called a, uh, car service.
Yeah, they're almost here.

336
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,970
So I'm gonna have my
assistant come down and deal...

337
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:09,237
You can't just leave.

338
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,967
I am a lawyer. I have a trial.

339
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:14,334
Why don't we do this? Why
don't you just take my ride?

340
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,612
That, uh, would be very helpful.

341
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:18,623
- Great.
- Thank you.

342
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:19,702
Sure, no problem.

343
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:23,051
Yeah, I'll just, um...
it's a black Town Car.

344
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,822
And, uh, the driver's
name is unpronounceable.

345
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:28,670
Ha! I can't even say...

346
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,636
- Hey, you called for a ride?
- Yes, thank you.

347
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:32,630
Would you be so kind as
to drive this young woman

348
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,096
wherever she would like to go?

349
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:36,331
I'm going to the county courthouse.

350
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,200
Chestnut and Jefferson.

351
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,412
I'm not gonna hurt you.

352
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,183
I don't really know how
we got here, Raymond.

353
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,714
I remember being an honest
businessman in a happy marriage

354
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:54,150
until you came along.

355
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,980
Constantin, I can save your life.

356
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,347
Seduced my wife.

357
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,187
To her credit, Katarina broke it off,

358
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,901
- but you couldn't let go.
- I have a cure.

359
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:03,158
I came home one night
and they were gone...

360
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,479
my wife, my child.

361
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:09,737
202-555-0198.

362
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:13,042
- My girl who's not even my girl.
- If you wanna live, call the number.

363
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,650
As you can imagine,
I have many questions.

364
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:17,252
There's a science.
Some sort of genetics.

365
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:19,636
It's called CRISPR.

366
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:22,591
Your magic bullet to save my life

367
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,423
is some experimental treatment

368
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:25,938
they're not even testing on humans.

369
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:27,663
CRISPR is not just experimental.

370
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:30,099
Gene re-sequencing may work someday,

371
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,822
but I won't live that long.

372
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:34,436
There was a breakthrough 19 years ago

373
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,305
by a scientist who was murdered.

374
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:40,375
His partner carried on his
work on humans, not animals,

375
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,444
with remarkable success.

376
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:45,673
I have a doctor who can
apply that science today.

377
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:48,083
I can make her available to you.

378
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:50,611
And why would you save my life?

379
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,988
Because I want you to save mine.

380
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,517
Call the number.

381
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:00,395
Because of my chronic illness,

382
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,831
I've become something of an expert

383
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,437
in pain management... what causes it,

384
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:07,503
and what prevents it.

385
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:11,976
Naturally occurring
toxins, bacterial proteins,

386
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,990
mutagens.

387
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:18,614
I'm confident Mr.
Kleeb can encourage you

388
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,316
to answer some of my questions, Raymond.

389
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,852
As I said, I have many.

390
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:36,341
Now, let's start at the beginning.

391
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:43,899
We'll deliver them in one hour.

392
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,980
The meeting is set. The same bus stop.

393
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,683
Just the doctor and Miss Bockes.

394
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,363
Where are you taking me?

395
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:56,495
Just need a little blood work.

396
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:00,445
Okay. All right.

397
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,313
That was Aram. No dice.

398
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:05,250
There's no business, no shell
companies, nothing that links to Kirk.

399
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:06,951
Anything on that silver panel van?

400
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,386
No, we gotta keep knocking.

401
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:11,238
We're never gonna find
Kirk's safe house this way.

402
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,405
They've been driving a silver panel van.

403
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,030
You see anything like
that around here today?

404
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,430
No. Who are they?

405
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,107
Did anyone enter the club
in the last hour or so?

406
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,688
Sure, but I wouldn't have let them
inside without a membership card.

407
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:32,913
You mind if we take a
look around just in case?

408
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:34,805
No, fine with me.

409
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:36,328
Excuse me.

410
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:37,826
Ressler.

411
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,936
All right, I'm looking at CCTV
feeds of a silver panel van

412
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:42,245
that crossed through the intersection

413
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:44,656
of Newmarket and Maiden
less than five minutes ago.

414
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,727
Aram's got eyes on the van.

415
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,452
All right, talk to me.

416
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:55,951
- What is it?
- Two cops asking questions.

417
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:58,617
They're gone now, but I can't
say they won't be coming back.

418
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,847
I had proof that she was my daughter.

419
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,549
A DNA test.

420
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:14,855
You saw what Katarina wanted you to see.

421
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:17,091
She lied to you

422
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:19,226
about everything.

423
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:23,465
KGB trained her to seduce...

424
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,835
foreign diplomats, intel... intelligence

425
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,582
personnel...

426
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,371
into...

427
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:35,943
believ... revealing secrets.

428
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:39,692
You always thought I was the interloper.

429
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:43,918
The truth is that I was an assignment.

430
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm... I'm sure you were, too.

431
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,688
That's a lie.

432
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,512
A cover then.

433
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:53,138
You were wealthy and powerful.

434
00:26:54,342 --> 00:26:55,896
Gave her access.

435
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:58,599
All that matters is
that we had a family,

436
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,301
and you destroyed it.

437
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,169
We had a daughter, and
you took her from us.

438
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,470
Why?

439
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,801
If I dose him again, it could
induce an Adrenergic storm.

440
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,646
We could lose him.

441
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,684
Are you her father?

442
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,842
Are you her father?

443
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,639
Answer me.

444
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:47,956
Let's go.

445
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:49,612
What good is killing me gonna do?

446
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:51,011
It won't bring him back.

447
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,216
He's gonna die. He can't be saved.

448
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:56,086
Well, he wouldn't need to be
saved if it wasn't for you.

449
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,988
Come on. Up, up.

450
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,589
He's dying because he's sick.

451
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,459
I'm not talking about his
death. That was inevitable.

452
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,995
I'm talking about who he's become

453
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,798
because of his obsession with you.

454
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,500
He was a good man when I met him.

455
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,571
And then he saw you, a
fugitive on television.

456
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:17,534
Finding you, that changed him.

457
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,112
He did things that I didn't
think he was capable of.

458
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,948
Terrible things. Awful.

459
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,451
I blame you for that.

460
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:49,819
You're going to jail.

461
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:55,937
No.

462
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:57,914
I'm not.

463
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,967
His heart rate is 122.

464
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,238
BP is 180 over 110.

465
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:13,163
We've made him tachycardic.

466
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,898
The antidote.

467
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:24,423
Pain.

468
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,277
Relief.

469
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,580
Which I administer next
is completely up to you.

470
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,917
So be it.

471
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:46,725
I don't know what this is.
I don't know why I'm here,

472
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,316
but I am a district attorney

473
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,824
and people will be looking for me.

474
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,003
- Who is she?
- She is a miracle.

475
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:55,082
Lucille was a patient of mine.

476
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:57,412
Lucille Bockes. That's not possible.

477
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:58,669
I know.

478
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:01,678
What trick are you playing?

479
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,021
It's not a trick.

480
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,732
It's proof of concept.

481
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:11,221
CRISPR?

482
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,957
It can save you.

483
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,528
If I let you go.

484
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,906
We both die...

485
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,800
or we both live.

486
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,358
It's up to you.

487
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,078
Run every test on her you can think of.

488
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,047
I don't believe in miracles.

489
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,883
You're telling me that
Reddington was there with Kirk.

490
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:42,018
Yeah. He traded himself for me.

491
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,820
They were in some kind of
an underground parking lot?

492
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,589
There were no signs, no markers.

493
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,157
They had my head
covered going in and out.

494
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,592
Any idea how close it is?

495
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:51,561
I'd say we drove 15, maybe 20 minutes.

496
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:54,654
10 mile radius to search. We're
right back to where we started.

497
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:56,900
No, we're not. I have an idea.

498
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,936
- Yeah.
- Aram, I have a question.

499
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:03,573
If the van Kirk's guys
were using has a GPS system,

500
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,919
could you use that to
retrace where it's been?

501
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,309
If the van has a telematics system,

502
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:12,192
it may have a two-way link to a
service provider that relays GPS data.

503
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:15,085
Okay, I'm standing at the van. What
do you need to make that happen?

504
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:18,622
Maybe she's a miracle.
Maybe she's not a miracle.

505
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:22,047
Either way, you're gonna
have to answer my question.

506
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,629
- No.
- You're not her father?

507
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,797
No, I'm not gonna answer your question.

508
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,521
It doesn't matter.

509
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:36,014
She lived at... at your house

510
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,185
as your daughter...

511
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:44,006
on and off for... four years.

512
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,959
Sometimes you were there,
sometimes you weren't.

513
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,054
What difference does it make?

514
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,875
Are you her father?

515
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:56,092
Sam Milhoan raised her after that.

516
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:58,032
Are you her father?

517
00:31:58,237 --> 00:31:59,844
It doesn't matter.

518
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,034
I can't.

519
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,468
If I inject him again...

520
00:32:07,738 --> 00:32:10,141
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

521
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:13,510
Is Masha your daughter?

522
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,943
What do you want me to say?

523
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:30,554
Yes...

524
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,227
Is that what you want me to say?

525
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,920
Yes, Elizabeth is my daughter.

526
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:56,065
- It's true?
- Yes. I did a full work up.

527
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,434
She's cured.

528
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,553
My proposition still stands.

529
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,841
- How?
- What does it matter how?

530
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:07,459
Dr. Shaw saved my life.

531
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:12,391
Dr. Shaw is standing by in a fully
assembled lab waiting for you.

532
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:23,660
I want everybody out. Clear the area.

533
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:25,628
Miss Bockes, you're free to go.

534
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,881
All of you, go.

535
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,299
Out!

536
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:40,387
So...

537
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,793
you can cure me.

538
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:46,793
How ironic. You, of all people.

539
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:51,777
But if the price for my life
is sharing the Earth with you,

540
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:55,637
I'm gonna have to turn you down.

541
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,742
All right, stay on Hampden unless you
cross 188, then take your next right.

542
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:05,001
Aram, we don't have time
to retrace the entire route.

543
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,070
The site had an underground
parking structure.

544
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,371
Does that help you filter the search?

545
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:11,841
Yeah, well, it would, except that van
covered over 40 miles of road today.

546
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,844
Aram, Keen said she was on the
road for 15, maybe 20 minutes.

547
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:17,513
Can you narrow the route pattern
to a specific window of time?

548
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:20,283
Determine the speed
and the number of stops.

549
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:23,019
The van made eight stops
in the last 96 minutes.

550
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,172
An apartment complex
in Friendship Heights,

551
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,438
a gym in Bethesda,

552
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:29,559
- what looks like a strip mall...
- Wait, wait. Did you say gym?

553
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,461
Uh, right. Bodhi Fitness.

554
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:33,496
That's the place.

555
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,891
Since we have a history together,

556
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,656
I'll give you the choice.

557
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:42,359
Would you prefer

558
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,234
to suffocate

559
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,378
or to have a heart attack?

560
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:48,911
You're not gonna kill me.

561
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:52,500
And why is that? Because
that means I'll die, too?

562
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,813
Dying isn't so bad.

563
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,454
I did it once in Marrakesh.

564
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:01,602
Suffocation. You talk too much.

565
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:05,595
Perhaps I should listen more.

566
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:11,553
Tell me about Katarina.

567
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,373
And why would I do that?

568
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:17,359
Because we both miss her.

569
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,428
Because...

570
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,490
after all these years...

571
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,706
I have forgotten what she was...

572
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:32,602
really like.

573
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,581
You remember what she did,

574
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,395
and not who she was.

575
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,232
Remind me.

576
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:48,504
When... when we...

577
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,143
when we first met,

578
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:54,432
there was this house

579
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,980
near where she lived, a case study house

580
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:03,596
built by this famous
mid-century architect.

581
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:07,790
Over dinner one night, she
said she wanted to look at it.

582
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,870
I thought she meant
look from the street.

583
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,377
But when we got there,

584
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,526
she jumped the fence.

585
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:19,435
The lights were on.

586
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:21,370
People lived there.

587
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:22,772
She didn't care.

588
00:36:23,174 --> 00:36:24,987
I stood there...

589
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,784
frozen, angry, nervous.

590
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Then I felt...

591
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:36,156
this rush of exhilaration.

592
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:38,424
I climbed up,

593
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:41,745
looked into the yard...

594
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:46,262
and she was just...

595
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:47,909
... Dancing.

596
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,041
... unafraid.

597
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:54,670
Daring. Being.

598
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,408
I'd never seen anything like it.

599
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,665
She had...

600
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:06,415
... A joy for living.

601
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:10,489
She was more alive than anyone I knew.

602
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,223
When I heard she killed herself...

603
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:20,774
I didn't believe it.

604
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:23,337
I still don't.

605
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,173
You're wrong.

606
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,446
I didn't see what she
wanted me to see of her,

607
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,032
I saw her.

608
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:36,684
And despite what happened,

609
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,731
I know she loved me.

610
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,289
You don't have to do this.

611
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,141
Raymond,

612
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:04,340
there's nothing in this world
you can tell me to change my mind.

613
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:01,111
Reddington did what?

614
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:04,338
We thought he kidnapped Dr. Shaw in
order to make sure that Kirk died.

615
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:07,213
But the truth is, he kidnapped her

616
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:08,971
hoping to keep Kirk alive.

617
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:10,873
The data recovered from
Kirk's lab indicates

618
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,708
that Reddington was
trying to prove to Kirk

619
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,127
that Shaw could save him.

620
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,556
Why the hell would he do that?

621
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,759
Why does Reddington do
any of the things he does?

622
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:19,782
- And where's Kirk?
- We don't know.

623
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,625
We're sure as hell gonna find out.

624
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,505
So it worked?

625
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,194
Yes.

626
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:26,492
I'll take that as a thank you.

627
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,673
Oh, my God.

628
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,196
How did you...

629
00:40:58,687 --> 00:40:59,887
Kirk?

630
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:03,194
- Gone.
- Dead?

631
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,742
Gone.

632
00:41:05,223 --> 00:41:07,273
I don't... I don't
understand. How did you...

633
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,664
It's over.

634
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:14,812
- May I?
- Mm.

635
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:21,828
Come here. Come here. Yes.

636
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,308
Here you go.

637
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:42,024
You know, I really
believed he was my father.

638
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:45,161
You had every reason to.

639
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:46,828
Except for one.

640
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,749
You.

641
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:53,086
You told me my father died when
I was a little girl. I just...

642
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:58,140
I guess I didn't want to believe it.

643
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:03,422
I really wanted my dad
here to see her grow up.

644
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:07,516
He would've wanted that, too.
