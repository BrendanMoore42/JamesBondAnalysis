00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,911
Agh!

<i>(orders shouted in the distance)</i>

6
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,268
Exactly 1 minute 52 seconds.
That's excellent.

7
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,716
Check.

8
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,551
Knight takes bishop.

9
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,592
Knight takes bishop.

10
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,831
King to rook two.

11
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,238
King to rook two.

12
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,150
Queen to king four.

13
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,719
Queen to king four.

14
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,558
My congratulations, sir.
A brilliant coup.

15
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,833
Siamese fighting fish.
Fascinating creatures.

16
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,354
Brave, but, on the whole, stupid.
Yes, they're stupid.

17
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,876
Except for the occasional one,
such as we have here,

18
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,679
who lets the other two fight...

19
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,394
while he waits.

20
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,871
Waits until the survivor is so exhausted
that he cannot defend himself.

21
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,439
Then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.

22
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,355
I find the parallel amusing.

23
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,475
Our organisation did not arrange for
you to come over from the Russians

24
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,994
just for amusement, Number Three.

25
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,357
Come in, Kronsteen.

26
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,431
Sit down, Number Three, while we listen
to what Number Five has devised for us.

27
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,992
I hope his efforts as director of planning
continue to be as successful as his chess.

28
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,672
They will be.

29
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,797
As you instructed,
I've planned for SPECTRE

30
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,714
to steal from the Russians
their new Lektor decoding machine.

31
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,998
For this we need the services of the
Russian Cryptograph Section in Turkey

32
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,789
and the help of the British Secret Service.

33
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,477
Neither the Russians nor the British
will be aware that they are working for us.

34
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,109
Number Three, is your section ready
to carry out the directives?

35
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,239
Yes, the operation will be organised
according to Kronsteen's plan.

36
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,074
I have selected a girl from
the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.

37
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,915
She's capable, cooperative, and
her loyalty to the state is beyond question.

38
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
You're sure she believes you're still
head of operations for Soviet Intelligence?

39
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,670
It's most unlikely she would know
I'm now working for SPECTRE.

40
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,799
Moscow has kept my defection secret
from everyone but the presidium.

41
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,155
For your sake, I hope so.

42
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,710
Kronsteen, you're sure
this plan is foolproof?

43
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,636
Yes, because I have anticipated every
possible variation of countermove.

44
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,875
But what makes you think that M will
oblige you by falling in with your plan?

45
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,872
For the simple reason that
this is so obviously a trap.

46
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,954
My reading of the British mentality is that
they always treat a trap as a challenge.

47
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,434
And they couldn't possibly pass up
the chance of getting the Lektor decoder.

48
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,239
They have wanted one for years.

49
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,993
All that you say could be true. What else?

50
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,232
SPECTRE will probably have
the chance of a personal revenge

51
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,198
for the killing of our operative Dr No,

52
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,432
because the man the British will almost
certainly use on a mission of this sort

53
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,034
would be their agent, James Bond.

54
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,513
Let his death be a particularly
unpleasant and humiliating one.

55
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,559
Good. I'll put my plan
into operation straight away.

56
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,677
And there will be no failure.

57
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,791
<i>(helicopter overhead)</i>

58
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,511
Hurry.

59
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,595
Welcome to SPECTRE Island.
I hope you had a pleasant flight.

60
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,759
My time is limited.
Is the man I requested ready?

61
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,831
- His dossier.
- Good.

62
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,274
Donald Grant, convicted murderer.

63
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,590
Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960,
recruited in Tangier in 1962.

64
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,955
Excellent.
Where is he now?

65
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,589
- At the lake.
- Bring him to my office, will you?

66
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,711
- Take me to the lake.
- Through the training area.

67
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,878
Grant's one of our best men.
Homicidal paranoiac, superb material.

68
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,077
His response to our training and
indoctrination have been remarkable.

69
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,151
<i>(gunfire)</i>

70
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,519
I hope our work here
meets with your approval.

71
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,589
Training is useful, but there is
no substitute for experience.

72
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,830
I agree. We use live targets as well.

73
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,515
- Call him.
- Grant!

74
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,274
He seems fit enough. Have him
report to me in Istanbul in 24 hours.

75
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,191
<i>(speak Russian)</i>

76
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,071
<i>(speak Turkish)</i>

77
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,755
Corporal of State Security
Tatiana Romanova.

78
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,271
Come in.

79
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,791
You know who I am?

80
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,108
Colonel Klebb,
head of operations for SMERSH.

81
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,159
I saw you once in Moscow, when
I worked for the English decoding room.

82
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,674
Did you tell anyone
you were coming here?

83
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,196
- No, the message...
- Yes, yes, I know. I sent it.

84
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,749
Your work record is excellent.

85
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,909
- The state is proud of you.
- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

86
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,992
Take off your jacket.

87
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,309
Turn around.

88
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,190
You're a fine-Iooking girl.

89
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,234
Sit down.

90
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,036
I see you trained for the ballet.

91
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,996
But I grew an inch
over the regulation height, and so...

92
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,071
And then you have had three lovers.

93
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,993
What is the purpose
of such an intimate question?

94
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,870
You're not here to ask questions.
You forget to whom you are speaking.

95
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,078
- I was in love.
- And if you were not in love?

96
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,316
I suppose that would depend on the man.

97
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,550
Sensible answer.
This man, for instance.

98
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,997
I cannot tell.
Perhaps if he was kind and <i>kulturny.</i>

99
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,710
Corporal, I have selected you
for a most important assignment.

100
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,076
Its purpose is to give
false information to the enemy.

101
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,913
If you complete it successfully,
you will be promoted.

102
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,709
From now on,
you will do anything he says.

103
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,191
- And if I refuse?
- Then you will not leave this room alive.

104
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,035
- I will obey your orders.
- Good. Now, these are your instructions.

105
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,634
You report to me here, but the consulate
security man must not know anything.

106
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,030
- This is classified far above his level.
- I will say nothing...

107
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,635
If you do, you will be shot.

108
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,757
Come, come, my dear.

109
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,790
You're very fortunate to have been chosen
for such a simple, delightful duty.

110
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,512
A real labour of love, as we say.

111
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,557
<i>(</i># <i>"From Russia With Love" on radio)</i>

112
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,833
- Great sport, this.
- What did you say?

113
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,469
I said it's great sport, this punting.

114
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,997
- I couldn't agree with him more.
- I may even give up golf for it.

115
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,798
Really?

116
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,951
Not quite.

117
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,552
Souvenir from another jealous woman?

118
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,517
Yes. But I haven't turned
my back on one since.

119
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,591
<i>(beeping)</i>

120
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,911
- Excuse me.
- What?

121
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,914
- Give me my shirt.
- What's going on?

122
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,750
- I have to make a phone call.
- But we haven't eaten yet.

123
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,274
I'm starving.

124
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,433
Come in, Univex.
James Bond here. Over.

125
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,272
He's been asking for you all morning.
Where in the world are you, James?

126
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,753
Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.

127
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,590
- So I'm an old case now, am I?
- It's the office.

128
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,911
- Tell him I'm on my way, will you?
- He is not on his way.

129
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,310
Sylvia, behave. We'll do this again
some other time soon.

130
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,836
Do what? Last time you said that,
you went off to Jamaica.

131
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,673
I haven't seen you for six months.

132
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,911
- I'll be there in an hour.
<i>- I'll tell him.</i>

133
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,513
Hey. Your old case
sounds interesting, James.

134
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,312
Make that an hour and a half.

135
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,431
Now, about that lunch.

136
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,832
For my next miracle, I...

137
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,076
It'll be a miracle if he can explain
where he's been all day.

138
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,637
But I've never even heard
of a Tatiana Romanova.

139
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,359
- Ridiculous, isn't it?
- It's absolutely crazy.

140
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,796
Of course, girls do fall in love
with pictures of film stars.

141
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,751
But not a Russian cipher clerk
with a file photo of a British agent.

142
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,714
Unless she's mental.

143
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,870
No, it's some sort of trap.

144
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,511
Obviously it's a trap, and the bait is
a cipher machine, a brand-new Lektor.

145
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,798
A Lektor, no less. The CIA's
been after one of those for years.

146
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,598
Yes, so have we.

147
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,037
When she contacted Kerim Bey,
head of Station T in Turkey,

148
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,432
and told him she wanted to defect,
she said she'd turn it over to us.

149
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,397
On one condition.

150
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,316
That you went out to Istanbul and brought
her and the machine back to England.

151
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,914
Here's a snapshot Kerim
managed to get of her.

152
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,037
I don't know too much
about cryptography,

153
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,635
but a Lektor could decode
their top secret signals.

154
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,871
The whole thing's so fantastic
it just could be true.

155
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,030
That had occurred to me.

156
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,433
Besides, the Russians haven't
been up to any tricks recently.

157
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,633
Well, really, I'm not too busy
at the moment, sir.

158
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,315
You're booked on the 8.30 plane
in the morning.

159
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,196
If there's any chance of us getting
a Lektor, we must look into it.

160
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,956
Suppose when she meets me in the flesh
I don't come up to expectations?

161
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,191
Just see that you do.

162
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,273
Miss Moneypenny, ask
the equipment officer to come in, please.

163
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,353
Q Branch has put together
a smart-Iooking piece of luggage for us.

164
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,432
We're issuing this
to all double-0 personnel.

165
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,513
An ordinary black leather case with
20 rounds of ammunition here and here.

166
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,959
Now, if you take the top off,
you'll find the ammunition inside.

167
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,713
In the side here,
a flat throwing knife.

168
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,993
Press that button there,
and out she comes.

169
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,395
Inside the case,
you'll find an AR7 folding sniper's rifle.

170
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,516
.25 calibre,
with an infrared telescopic sight.

171
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,992
Then, if you pull out these straps, inside
are 50 gold sovereigns, 25 in either side.

172
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,154
Now, watch very carefully.
An ordinary tin of talcum powder.

173
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,391
Inside, a tear-gas cartridge. That
goes in the case against the side here.

174
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,393
It's magnetised, so it won't fall.
Shut the case.

175
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,996
Normally, to open a case like that,
you move the catches to the side.

176
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,516
If you do, the cartridge
will explode in your face.

177
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,399
Now, to stop the cartridge exploding,
turn the catches horizontally, like that.

178
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,275
Then, open normally.

179
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,035
Now you try it.

180
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,796
- Turn the catches like that.
- That's right.

181
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,515
And open ordinarily.

182
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,311
- You got it?
- Yes, I think so.

183
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,594
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks very much.

184
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,231
Nasty little Christmas present.
But I shouldn't need it on this assignment.

185
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,517
All the same, take it with you.
Good luck, 007.

186
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,591
Thank you, sir.

187
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,514
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

188
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,397
And one plane ticket. Lucky man.
I've never been to Istanbul.

189
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,835
- You've never been to Istanbul?
- No.

190
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,959
Where the moonlight on the Bosphorus
is irresistible?

191
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,114
Maybe I should get you to take me there
someday. I've tried everything else.

192
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,875
Darling Moneypenny, you know
I never even look at another woman.

193
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,599
Really, James?

194
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,353
Let me tell you
the secret of the world.

195
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,158
<i>(buzzing)</i>

196
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,875
<i>Miss Moneypenny,</i>
<i>ask 007 to leave the photograph.</i>

197
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,188
<i>I'm sure he'll recognise</i>
<i>the lady when he sees her.</i>

198
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,397
- Good luck.
- Ciao.

199
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,911
Ciao.

200
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,155
Hello, London.
Your flight PA1 just landed Istanbul.

201
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,870
Mr Bond.

202
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,756
- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.
- Fine.

203
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,593
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

204
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,353
- It's better still.
- Until they go wrong.

205
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,910
- Exactly.
- I'll get the car, sir.

206
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,957
Kerim Bey suggested that you see him
before going to the hotel.

207
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,109
- Would that be convenient?
- Fine.

208
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,316
I suppose it's customary to have
people tailing you in these parts.

209
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,072
Oh, yes.
Today it's Citroën H31854 on duty.

210
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,153
Bulgarians working for the Russians.
They follow us, we follow them.

211
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,994
- It's a sort of understanding we have.
- That's very friendly.

212
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,557
Ah, my friend, come in, come in.

213
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,674
Glad to see you. Welcome to Istanbul.

214
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,753
Thank you for sending the car.
But it does rather tie you in with me.

215
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,630
You're in the Balkans now. The game
with the Russians is played differently.

216
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,599
For routine matters, we don't make it
too difficult to keep a tab on each other.

217
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,231
So I gathered from your chauffeur.
He's a rather intelligent young man.

218
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,390
He should be. He's my son.

219
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,153
- Coffee?
- Medium sweet.

220
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,358
Two medium sweet.

221
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,150
He also is my son.

222
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,912
All my key employees are my sons.
Blood is the best security in this business.

223
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,312
- You must have quite an establishment.
- Biggest family payroll in Turkey.

224
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,871
Not bad for a man who used to
break chains and bend bars in a circus.

225
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,239
- But let's talk about your business.
- M thinks I'm wasting my time here.

226
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,070
And so do I.
This is an old friend of mine.

227
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,675
- And it tells me something smells.
- Maybe.

228
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,513
But if there's
a chance of getting a Lektor...

229
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,068
Now you tell me.
Where can I contact this girl?

230
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,711
She said she would make her own
arrangements. You'll have to wait.

231
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,314
Thank you.

232
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,354
My friend,
if you really want my advice,

233
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,039
you should spend a few pleasant days
with us here in Istanbul, then go home.

234
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,949
- James Bond, I have a reservation.
- Your room is ready.

235
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,471
Number 32.

236
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
- 32 for Mr Bond.
- Hope you enjoy your stay.

237
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,791
Thank you.

238
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,112
<i>(porter clears throat)</i>

239
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,031
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Only this. Thank you.

240
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,111
Thank you, sir.

241
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,273
Mr Bond here.
I'm afraid the room won't do.

242
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,509
- The bed's too small.
- One moment, sir. Did you hear that?

243
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,229
Tell him that's all there is.
Unless he would like the bridal suite.

244
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,393
I'm sorry, sir. That's all we have available,
except the bridal suite.

245
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,074
Well, let's have a look at it.
I may like it.

246
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,154
The porter will show it to you.
He will be up immediately.

247
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,829
Good.

248
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,037
Good work. Who can the Russians
suspect but the British?

249
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,554
The Cold War in Istanbul
will not remain cold very much longer.

250
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,629
Ali Kerim Bey...

251
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,118
- Ali Kerim Bey.
- Mm.

252
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,751
Ali Kerim Bey.

253
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,308
You are not glad to see me this morning?

254
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,831
Overjoyed.

255
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,632
I no longer please you?

256
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,549
Be still.

257
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,197
Back to the salt mines.

258
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,235
Careful with those papers.

259
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,799
- Well, who won?
- I had visitors.

260
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,590
Limpet mine on the wall outside.
Timed to catch me at my desk.

261
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,434
But, by good fortune, I was relaxing
on the settee for a few moments.

262
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,911
- The girl left in hysterics.
- Found your technique too violent?

263
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,632
I can't understand this sudden breach
of the truce. It's unlike the Russians.

264
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,996
Most inconsiderate. My visit
might have something to do with it.

265
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,514
Let's try and find out.

266
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,109
Close up afterwards.

267
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,677
Quite a place.

268
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,875
The Emperor Constantine built it
as a reservoir 1600 years ago.

269
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,349
Really?

270
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,431
Here.

271
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,154
My daily exercise: At eleven in the
morning and three in the afternoon.

272
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,315
Tie her up, will you?

273
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,554
Mind your head now.

274
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,592
Underneath the Russian Consulate.

275
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,232
A present from your navy.

276
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,229
Our friends were turned out
by the Public Works Ministry.

277
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,275
The story was that the heavy traffic
was shaking the foundations.

278
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,636
By the time the place was declared safe,
I had this installed.

279
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,109
I can see everything
M said about you is right.

280
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,714
You know why I stay
in this mad business?

281
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,439
It could be that you find
selling rugs a bore.

282
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,671
My friend, you should be a mind-reader.

283
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,799
Head of the table is General Vassili,
director of Military Intelligence.

284
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,158
On his left:
Koslovski, Chief of Security.

285
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,038
Opposite him:
Benz, one of his agents.

286
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,190
I can't see the face of the other man,
the one the general is shouting at.

287
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,115
- He's giving him a hell of a blowing up.
- It's too bad we can't hear as well as see.

288
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,991
Tell me. Does our girl Romanova
ever come to this room?

289
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,988
Sometimes, with messages.

290
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,878
I can see the face of the other man now.

291
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,833
Krilencu.

292
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,592
So he's back.
Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.

293
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,789
Just the man for the limpet mine job.

294
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,959
I've had trouble with him before.

295
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,589
But he's stayed out of Istanbul
for over a year now.

296
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,433
Take a look.
You should remember him.

297
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,239
This man kills for pleasure.

298
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,391
Nice face.

299
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,753
Just a moment.
A girl's just come in.

300
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,389
Probably Romanova.
She's the only one who's allowed to.

301
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,278
How does she look to you?

302
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,632
From this angle,
things are shaping up nicely.

303
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,793
I'd like to see her in the flesh. Yes.

304
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,116
- Could you get me a plan of that place?
- I wish I could.

305
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
But there must be
the original drawing somewhere.

306
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,840
I'll get onto that.

307
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,754
Now, I need a little time
to deal with this stinking Krilencu.

308
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,273
It will be better if you didn't
stay at the hotel tonight. Come.

309
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,831
I see now why you keep the Rolls.

310
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,955
One of my sons is driving it.
With two dummies in the back.

311
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,272
In the opposite direction.
They'll follow it for hours.

312
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,749
You'll like my Gypsy friends.

313
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,436
I use them like the Russians the Bulgars.
It's created a blood feud between them.

314
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,871
<i>(music)</i>

315
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,949

Two girls in love with the same man
have threatened to kill each other.

320
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,234
As I'm an old friend of the family,
we can stay.

321
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,629
We're bidden to table. I hope
you are good at eating with your fingers.

Raki. Filthy stuff.

Quick.

325
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,117
Tell our host
his hospitality overwhelms me.

326
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,119
Thank you. Thank you.

327
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,431

say and do nothing.

who will marry the chief's son.

- I think I got it without the subtitles.

333
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,551
Thank you!

334
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,753
- Did you get Krilencu?
- No.

335
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,830
Just a minute.
Here. Thank you.

336
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,392
You fought well.
I am nothing but a clumsy old man.

337
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,353
<i>(man screams)</i>

338
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,273
They're making one
of the wounded Bulgars talk.

00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,555
<i>(man addresses Kerim Bey)</i>

340
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,392
It was me they were after.
Why would they want me out of the way?

341
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,230
Tomorrow we will have to find
Krilencu's hide-out.

342
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:13,908
- Meantime, I'll take care of this filthy stuff.
- <i>(man speaks to Bond)</i>

343
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,832
Vavra thanks you for saving his life.
You are now his son.

344
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,193
Thank you.

345
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,510
I'd like to ask him a favour.
Could he stop the girl fight?

346
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,634
Your heart is too soft to be a real Gypsy.
But he lets you decide the matter.

347
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,915
As if I didn't have enough problems.

348
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,912
Vavra said for you to decide. So decide.

349
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,432
They're both yours.

350
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,194
This might take some time.

351
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,671
- Did you pick up the package?
- It's on the seat.

352
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,191
Thank you.

353
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,231
Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.
The third time he will succeed.

354
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,389
Unless I get him first.
And that I'll do tonight.

355
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,837
Not with that arm, you won't.
You'd better leave it to me.

356
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,516
- I'm already too much in your debt.
- How can a friend be in debt?

357
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,911
Here.

358
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,271
Infrared lens.

359
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,031
Shh.

360
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,631
<i>(footsteps)</i>

361
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,197
My sons.

362
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,315
They will ring his doorbell.
He has a private escape hatch.

363
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,592
Try this for size.

364
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,550
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.

365
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,594
She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.

366
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,671
Yes, I see what you mean.

367
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,111
Arm or no arm,
I have to pull that trigger.

368
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,792
If you think you can.
You've got one shot, remember.

369
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,678
It'll have to do.

370
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,271
Quick. He's coming.

371
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,631
Quick.

372
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,879
Aah!

373
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,710
That pays many debts.

374
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,199
She should have kept her mouth shut.

375
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,913
Hello?

376
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,035
Breakfast for one at nine please.

377
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,478
Green figs, yoghurt,
coffee - very black. Thank you.

378
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,711
<i>(sniffs)</i>

379
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,671

380

<i>(creaking)</i>

381
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,029
You look surprised.
I thought you were expecting me.

382
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,677
So you are Tatiana Romanova?

383
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,354
My friends call me Tania.

384
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,432
Mine call me James Bond.

385
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,593
Well, now that we've been
properly introduced...

386
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,873
Careful. Guns upset me.

387
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,190
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit upset myself.

388
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,469
You look just like your...
your photograph.

389
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,355
You're one of the most beautiful girls ever.

390
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,591
Thank you, but I think
my mouth is too big.

391
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,078
No, it's the right size.

392
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,989
For me, that is.

393
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,431
Yes.

394
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,159
- Is it here?
- What?

395
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,558
The decoding machine. Lektor.

396
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,072
Must we talk about it now?

397
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,797
Or is it at the Russian Consulate?

398
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,193
Yes.

399
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,839
Yes... I would need a plan of the place.

400
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,433
If you could get one, we could meet
at the Saint Sophia mosque as tourists.

401
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,593
Why don't you ask me that later?

402
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,632
- Now what are you looking for?
- The scar.

403
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,914
You see?
I know all about you from your file.

404
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,676
You do? Well,
I hope you're not disappointed.

405
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,231
I will tell you...

406
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,034
in the morning.

407
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,834
We are now approaching the most
interesting corner of Saint Sophia.

408
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,837
Including these two great red porphyry
columns, stolen and brought from Egypt.

409
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,870
In front of them, alabaster urn
was brought from Bergama,

410
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,112
a famous historical city near Smyrna.

411
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,876
It dates back from
the Alexander the Great period.

412
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:18,197
About 1648 Sultan Murad IV
brought it from Bergama.

413
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:26,870
It was used as an ablution fountain.
It contains a thousand litres of water.

414
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,589
Right after the ablution fountain,

415
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,879
we are going to a highly
interesting column over there,

416
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,991
known for centuries
as the Saint Sophia wishing column.

417
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,154
Tens of thousands of people
have wished here,

418
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,634
putting their right hand
and middle finger in the hole.

419
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,999
I promise you - it wasn't
one of my men who killed him.

420
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,108
He didn't die of old age.
All I know is that it saved me the job.

421
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,556
Once he'd seen the girl,
she was compromised, and so...

422
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,155
And he wasn't killed because of that.

423
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,596
Let's just say that Istanbul's a rough town.

424
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,071
Let's see how Tania's map
compares with your architect's plans.

425
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,631
This is conference room of
the Russian Consulate. That checks.

426
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,429
And this here is the communication room.
That's the same.

427
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,069
And she says she works there
with the Lektor between two and three.

428
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,553
- How is she gonna get the machine to us?
- She'll do anything I say.

429
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,758
Anything.
My dear James, you're not using this.

430
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,038
It all sounds too easy. We don't
even know if she's telling the truth.

431
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,908
- I intend to find out.
- Where? In the hotel?

432
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,992
No. She won't go there again.
She says it's too dangerous.

433
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,437
The old game.
Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.

434
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,954
My friend, she's got you dangling.

435
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,554
That doesn't matter.

436
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,757
- All I want is that Lektor.
- AII?

437
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,037
Are you sure that's all you want?

438
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,509
Well...

439
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,634
- Lovely view.
- James, we must leave here now.

440
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,599
- If that agent reports my meeting you...
- Don't worry. He won't.

441
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,752
But you don't understand the danger.

442
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,232
- James, look up.
- Smile.

443
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,472
Another one. Further back.

444
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,750
- About the machine...
- That's all you are interested in. Not me.

445
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,671
Business first.

446
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,194
I know, once you have got
what you want...

447
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,236
I haven't got it yet.

448
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,518
But, afterwards, we won't always
be working on the company's time.

449
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,755
All right. What do you want to know?

450
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,718
Talk into this.
Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.

451
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,159
How large is the machine?

452
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,471
Like... like a typewriter.

453
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,235
- Weight?
- About ten kilos.

454
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,517
In a brown case.
Brown like your eyes.

455
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,196
Keep it technical.
Self-calibrating or manual?

456
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,559
Both, with an in-built compensator.

457
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,757
- James, couldn't we...
- Not now.

458
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,197
Talk into the camera.
How many keys?

459
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,317
- Symbol or code keys?
- Both.

460
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,597
<i>There are 24 symbols and 16 code keys.</i>

461
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,559
<i>It is inserted in a slot and</i>
<i>the message comes out in a paper roll</i>

462
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,155
<i>from another slot on the other side.</i>
<i>The mechanism is...</i>

463
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,119
<i>Oh, James, James, will you</i>
<i>make love to me all the time in England?</i>

464
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,839
<i>Day and night.</i>
<i>Go on about the mechanism.</i>

465
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,070
<i>Oh, yes, the mechanism.</i>

466
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,596
<i>Once, when it was being repaired,</i>
<i>I saw the insides.</i>

467
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,515
<i>There were many perforated discs,</i>
<i>made I think of copper, with a small light.</i>

468
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,993
<i>Dushka</i>, <i>tell me the truth, am I</i>
<i>as exciting as all those Western girls?</i>

469
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,959
<i>Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,</i>
<i>we had an interesting experience.</i>

470
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,431
Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.
That's all, that's all.

471
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,834
<i>Later, later.</i>

472
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,633
<i>- Those copper discs and the light...</i>
<i>- Oh, the light, the light.</i>

473
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,553
<i>James, come closer.</i>
<i>I want to whisper something.</i>

474
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,677
<i>Go on. No, not that.</i>
<i>The mechanism.</i>

475
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,118
<i>(M) Miss Moneypenny, as you're no doubt</i>
<i>listening, perhaps you'd take this cable?</i>

476
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:43,389
"Merchandise appears genuine. Stop.
Go ahead with deal." Signed, M.

477
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,155
Now all I have to do
is to tell the girl the date.

478
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,835
- The 13th?
- The 14th.

479
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,149
Visas?

480
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,437
Visas? Thank you.

481
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,475
Visa, please.

482
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,835
Your clock, is it correct?

483
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,515
- Always.
- Of course.

484
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,637
Excuse me.
You did say your clock was correct?

485
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,711
Russian clocks are always...

486
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,509
- Is this the Lektor?
- Yes.

487
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,999
<i>(coughs)</i>

488
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,674
- Take this.
- It thought it was for tomorrow.

489
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,197
- Today is the 13th, isn't it?
- It's a hell of a time to be superstitious.

490
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,071
Come on. Quickly.

491
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,031
<i>(sirens)</i>

492
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,911
Keep your head down.

493
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,591
Argh!

494
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,874
Back inside.

495
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,751
This way. Quickly.

496
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,233
- What's the matter?
- Benz, the Russian security man.

497
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,789
Come on. Never mind.

498
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,075
Hurry. Hurry.

499
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,831
<i>(speak Russian)</i>

500
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,635
Here's one of them.
And there's the other one.

501
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,239
Your passports.
The pictures do not do you justice.

502
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,153
I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.

503
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,800
Mr and Mrs David Somerset.

504
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,793
- Your name's Caroline.
- Caroline. I like that name.

505
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,599
You're accompanying me
on a business trip on our way home.

506
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,955
- To our children?
- No children.

507
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,952
- Not even one little boy?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

508
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:21,875
I like big families. My whole life
has been a crusade for larger families.

509
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,554
- So I heard. Tania?
- Yes?

510
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,835
Keep the door locked.
I'll knock three times.

511
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,955
OK.

512
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,313
- I'll go see the conductor.
- You're sure he'll cooperate?

513
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,391
We've done business before.

514
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,553
He'll stop the train near the frontier,
where my sons will be waiting with a car.

515
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,349
- We'll be there about six o'clock.
- And the airstrip?

516
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,829
20 miles.

517
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,956
The plane is chartered to Athens.
You'll be in London tomorrow.

518
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,112
We'll drink to that in London.

519
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,158
So, we are really on our way to England.

520
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,674
Yes, with a lovely
two-day honeymoon before us.

521
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,070
Honeymoon? And I've nothing to wear.

522
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,550
- Your trousseau.
- Oh, James.

523
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,631
One moment.

524
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,676
Oh. Oh, no. James, James!

525
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,957
Oh, look, look.

526
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,670
There.

527
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,151
<i>(hums)</i>

528
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,712
I will wear this one in Piccadilly.

529
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,793
You won't.
They've just passed some new laws there.

530
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,313
- You're nearest.
- Oh, all right.

531
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,592
Charming. Charming.

532
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,233
Let's go to the restaurant car,
James, for that drink.

533
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,038
Surely.

534
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,111
Charming.

535
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,952
We'll continue the fashion show later.

536
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,909
Everything's arranged for me to stop the
train. We'll get off at the restaurant car.

537
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,991
Fine. We'll meet you there at six.

538
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,231
Make it just a little later.
But there are complications.

539
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,632
One of the Russian security men,
Benz, he's on the train.

540
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,439
But he wouldn't have had time
to contact the consulate.

541
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,195
Just in case, I'll keep him company
until it's time to get off.

542
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,273
- Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you.
- Charming.

543
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,550
<i>(knock)</i>

544
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,631
Ticket control.

545
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,992
Do not be alarmed. We will make
you as comfortable as possible.

546
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,630
Now I'm sure Commissar Benz
will have a much safer journey.

547
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,393
I'm not mad about his tailor, are you?

548
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,109
You know, James, life in Istanbul
will never be the same without you.

549
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,634
See you in the restaurant car.

550
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,349
I've had a particularly fascinating life.

551
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,273
Would you like to hear about it?

552
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,112
You would?

553
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,471
<i>(knocking)</i>

554
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,793
- You like it?
- Yes, it does rather suit you.

555
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,874
- I will save everything else for England.
- It is four o'clock, you know.

556
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,111
This is not <i>kulturny</i> in the afternoon?

557
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,634
Even on a honeymoon?

558
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,518
Then I will take it off.

559
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,998
I think we're talking
at cross purposes again.

560
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,679
- Tania.
- Mm-hm?

561
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,348
We'd better get dressed now.

562
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,035
- Why?
- It's almost six.

563
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,190
So?

564
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,750
Well, it's teatime.

565
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,910
We'll have it in here.

566
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,358
- We'll have all our meals here.
- Yes, that would be splendid.

567
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,319
But I've arranged to meet Kerim
in the restaurant car.

568
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,836
You go alone. I will stay here.

569
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,311
My dear Mrs Somerset, we're supposed
to be a respectable English couple.

570
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,676
They would certainly have tea
in the restaurant.

571
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,591
Now listen...

572
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,229
- Just do as I say, will you?
- Yes, James.

573
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,314
But there are some English customs
that are going to be changed.

574
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,789
But of course, darling.

575
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,830
Do I look right, Mr Somerset?

576
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,911
Yes...

577
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,150
- Mrs Somerset.
- <i>(in Russian)</i> How pretty.

578
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,238
Mr Somerset. Mr Somerset.

579
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,517
- You are the friend of Kerim Bey?
- Yes?

580
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,559
There's been a terrible accident.
Please come with me.

581
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,428
- No tea?
- Later. Keep the door locked.

582
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,040
They killed each other.

583
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,436
- This must be kept quiet until Trieste.
- It will be difficult.

584
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,034
I'm sure.

585
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:18,150
Kerim Bey had many influential friends.
I'm sure they also will reward you.

586
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,879
I will try.

587
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,031
<i>(knocking)</i>

588
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,235
What is it?

589
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,834
- Kerim's dead.
- Dead?

590
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,598
I want the truth.

591
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,593
- James, you are hurting me.
- I'll do worse if you don't tell me.

592
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,752
You're doing this under orders, I know.
What are they?

593
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,638
- I don't know what you mean.
- Liar.

594
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,516
Even if you kill me, I can say nothing.

595
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,559
I did not know anything
like Kerim's death would happen.

596
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,473
But when we get to England, I tell you.

597
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,679
- Go on.
- Oh, no.

598
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,235
Maybe they didn't let you in on all of it,
but whatever you do know, tell me.

599
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,393
- I know I love you, James. I love you.
- Just tell me.

600
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,472
I love you, I love you, it's true.

601
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,191
Sure.

602
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,593
Belgrade. Belgrade.

603
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,311
Excuse me.

604
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,472
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

605
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,553
- Better still.
- Until they go wrong.

606
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,519
My brother telephoned me.
Why did the train not stop?

607
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,354
Well, I have some bad news.

608
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,000
Your father's dead.

609
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,718
Who did it? Tell me.

610
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,156
He took care of that himself.
The other man died first.

611
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,231
Now listen...

612
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,598
I'll need help to get across the frontier
between Yugoslavia and Trieste.

613
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,989
I want you to send a message
to M in London:

614
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,390
Tell him to send someone
from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.

615
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,675
I will.

616
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,751
Good.

617
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,031
Oh.

618
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,872
You'II... I think you'll want these.

619
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,794
- Monsieur Somerset, <i>le train part.</i>
- Thank you.

620
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,919
- Captain Nash.
- Bond, travelling as Somerset.

621
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,991
My card.

622
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,479
- What kept you?
- I only got M's wire an hour ago.

623
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,757
I busted every record getting here.

624
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,233
- What were M's orders?
- To contact you and the lady on the train.

625
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,914
Good. Come this way.

626
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,391
Thank you.

627
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,991
<i>(knocking)</i>

628
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,990
This is my wife Caroline.
Captain Nash.

629
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,150
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to meet you.

630
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,118
- This way, Nash. Sit down, will you?
- Thank you.

631
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:37,189
- Been long in Yugoslavia?
- About three years.

632
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,590
- Interesting work?
- Yes, sometimes.

633
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,911
You know how it is, old man.

634
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,629
- You look very fit, Nash.
- Yes, I try to keep in shape.

635
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,391
So what's our problem, sir?

636
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,237
I can't risk taking this through the
customs at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.

637
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,153
No stops till then.
We'd have to jump off.

638
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,637
- Can you get us across?
- Any of the opposition around?

639
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,510
- Not in any condition to worry about.
- Good. We'll make it.

640
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,956
I know this territory
like the back of my hand.

641
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:19,315
Do you mind if we have a bite to eat?
I've been on the go since breakfast.

642
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,119
No, of course not.
We'll go to the restaurant car.

643
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,034
Caroline, you go with Nash.
I'll join you there in a few minutes.

644
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,112
Whatever you say, old man.
Excuse me.

645
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,669
Excuse me.

646
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,555
There you are, old man.

647
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,349
I was worried
something had happened to you.

648
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,749
<i>- Voilà, monsieur.</i>
- Thank you.

649
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,239
Thank you.

650
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,517
I'll have the grilled sole.

651
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,992
And for madam.
What about you, Nash?

652
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,197
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Make that three of those, will you?

653
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,196
- I'll have a bottle of Blanc de Blancs.
- Make mine chianti.

654
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,159
- White chianti?
- No, the red kind.

655
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,356
Well, enjoy your dinner, old man.

656
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,557
I've got the answer to our problems.
Very simple, really.

657
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,709
Good.

658
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,038
We should reach the border
in about an hour.

659
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,516
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Somerset.
That was clumsy of me.

660
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,591
- Waiter.
- <i>Monsieur.</i>

661
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,112
- Waiter.
<i>- Tout de suite, monsieur.</i>

662
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,198
- Excuse me. <i>Merci.</i>
- You'll find Trieste quite interesting.

663
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,272
Of course, it's not London.

664
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,238
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

665
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,112
I don't feel very well.

666
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,678
My head...

667
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,753
- The lady's come over faint.
- Bring her in here.

668
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,833
What is wrong with me?

669
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,473
- Let's go next door.
- Exhaustion, I'd say.

670
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,790
What was it,
the stuff you put in her drink?

671
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,189
Chloral hydrate.
Quick, but mild.

672
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,272
- And?
- Take it easy, 007.

673
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:30,078
My escape route's only for one.
What are you after, the girl or the Lektor?

674
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,351
All right.

675
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,994
- What is your plan?
- Explain it better on a map. All right?

676
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,879
Now, we're here, you see?

677
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,158
When we reach there, there's a steep
gradient. The train slows down there.

678
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,552
We'll block the line,
make for that main road, pick up a car.

679
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,312
A truck, in fact.

680
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,392
That must be about 20 miles from here...

681
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,595
Keep still.

682
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,152
All right, now. Get up on your knees.

683
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,348
Put your hands in your pockets.
Keep them there.

684
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,439
Red wine with fish.
That should have told me something.

685
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,233
You may know the right wines,
but you're the one on your knees.

686
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,880
How does it feel, old man?

687
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,272
Old man? Is that what you chaps
in SMERSH call each other?

688
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,516
SMERSH?

689
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,070
Of course. SPECTRE.

690
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,317
It wasn't a Russian show at all.

691
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,518
You've been playing us off
against each other, haven't you?

692
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:48,309
It was SPECTRE who killed
the Russian agent in the mosque.

693
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,437
- You?
- Mm-hm.

694
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,476
- Kerim and the other man?
- Mm-hm.

695
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,631
And Nash?

696
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,836
I don't mind talking.

697
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:04,392
I get a kick out of watching James Bond
find out what a bloody fool he's been.

698
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,471
We're pros, Mr Bond.

699
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:12,351
We sweated your recognition code out of
one of your men in Tokyo before he died.

700
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,558
I've been keeping tabs on you.
I've been your guardian angel.

701
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,839
Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.

702
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,072
Oh, yes.
I'm much obliged.

703
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,790
We were keeping you alive
until you could get us the Lektor.

704
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,635
So you had me deliver it on a plate.
That's brilliant.

705
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,312
Go on. I'm fascinated.

706
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,671
Now that we've got it,
you and the girl are expendable.

707
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,716
Between here and Trieste.

708
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,196
The girl?

709
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,955
- Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?
- No.

710
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,271
She thinks she's doing it all
for Mother Russia.

711
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,750
She takes her orders
from Colonel Klebb.

712
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,310
Rosa Klebb's Russian.
Head of operations for SMERSH.

713
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,311
Was.

714
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,393
Klebb works for SPECTRE now.
The girl doesn't know that.

715
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,470
- Then why kill her?
- Orders.

716
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,717
That's only half of it, old man.

717
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,998
Here's a roll of film.
She'll have this in her handbag.

718
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,833
And on you, they'll find this letter.

719
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,310
It's from her, threatening
to give the film to the press

720
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,949
unless you marry her
for helping you get the Lektor.

721
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,917
What film?

722
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,595
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.

723
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,834
Something else the girl
didn't know about. Or you.

724
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,232
It must be a pretty sick collection
of minds to dream up a plan like that.

725
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,880
Can't you see the headlines?

726
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,033
"British agent murders beautiful
Russian spy, then commits suicide."

727
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,476
Tell me, which lunatic asylum
did they get you out of?

728
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,435
Don't make it tougher on yourself.

729
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,157
My orders are to kill you
and deliver the Lektor.

730
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,834
How I do it is my business.

731
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,833
- It'll be slow and painful.
- How much are they paying you?

732
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,229
- What's it to you?
- We'll double it.

733
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,758
Your word of honour?

734
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,956
As an English gentleman?

735
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,549
The first one won't kill you.

736
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,074
Not the second.

737
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,232
Not even the third.

738
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,756
Not till you crawl over here
and you kiss my foot.

739
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,718
- How about a cigarette?
- Not a chance.

740
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,910
I'll pay for it.

741
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,197
- What with?
- 50 gold sovereigns.

742
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,790
- Where are they?
- Up there, in my case.

743
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,789
You show me.

744
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,037
Here you are.
What about that cigarette?

745
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,918
Throw 'em down there.

746
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,875
Any more in the other case?

747
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,117
I should imagine so. It's standard kit.
I'll have a look.

748
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,397
Put your hands back in your pockets.

749
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,319
Keep them there.

750
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,752
You won't be needing this...

751
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,512
old man.

752
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,548
Tania. Wake up.

753
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,518
Wake up, or I'll leave you behind.

754
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,990
Tania, wake up or I'll leave you behind,
do you hear me?

755
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,753
Don't leave me. Never leave me.

756
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,917
Tania, this is Nash's escape route.
You understand?

757
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,312
We've got to get off here.
Take this. Come on.

758
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:07,679
We must get to the other side of the train.
Under here.

759
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,796
<i>(whistles)</i>

760
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,359
Grant, where are you? Grant?

761
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,317
Excuse me.

762
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,756
Now, don't run away.

763
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,071
Come on.

764
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,755
- Come on, or I'll leave you here.
- Stay here with me.

765
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,275
Sleep it off in there.
You'll feel better in the morning.

766
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,231
Come on, wake up.

767
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,029
Try and straddle the truck.

768
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,113
I'll get them away from here.
You hide under the truck.

769
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,637
I'd say one of their aircraft is missing.

770
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,834
Tania.

771
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:32,469
- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.
- All right.

772
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,157
Where's the key? Where's the key?

773
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,834
In my coat. In the pocket.

774
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,799
All right, get out. Move.
In the boat.

775
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,315
Do you swim?

776
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,188
Take the wheel.
This way, please.

777
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,509
Mind the step.

778
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,478
Just isn't your day, is it?

779
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,478
- Where are we going?
- Venice.

780
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,870
Take a look at that locker, will you?

781
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,554
Charts, pistol, some flares.

782
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,438
Give me those charts.

783
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,872
Yes, we're here, near Istria.

784
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,796
We've got plenty of fuel.
With luck we should be there by morning.

785
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,718
Three man were found dead on the train
at Trieste. One of them was Grant.

786
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,791
What have you to say, Number Five?

787
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,792
He was Klebb's choice.
Her people failed.

788
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,838
It was your plan.
They followed it implicitly.

789
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,388
Impossible. It was perfect.

790
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,119
Except for one thing:
They were dealing with Bond.

791
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:15,079
Who is Bond compared with Kronsteen?

792
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:19,836
Exactly. What have you
to say to that, Number Three?

793
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,229
Bond is still alive and the Lektor
is not yet in our possession.

794
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,029
I have already negotiated
with the Russians to return it to them.

795
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:37,875
We've agreed a price. And SPECTRE
always delivers what it promises.

796
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:42,750
Our whole organisation depends
on our keeping those promises.

797
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,792
I warned you. We do not tolerate failure,
Number Three. You know the penalty.

798
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,235
Yes, Number One.

799
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,753
Our rules are very simple. If you fail...

800
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:15,637
12 seconds. One day we must
invent a faster-working venom.

801
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,870
- Number Three.
- Yes?

802
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:21,316
I do not wish to tell the Russians
there will be another delay.

803
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,312
There will be no delay, Number One.
There's still time.

804
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,634
- Which way are we going?
- The shortest route.

805
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:41,157
Which is between those two mountains
and straight along the coast.

806
01:41:56,160 --> 01:42:00,073
<i>Ahoy, Mr Bond. Ahoy, Mr Bond.</i>

807
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,870
<i>Heave to. Heave to.</i>

808
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:25,108
<i>You're trapped, Mr Bond.</i>
<i>You're trapped.</i>

809
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,113
<i>You cannot escape. You cannot escape.</i>

810
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,437
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

811
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,073
We're coming through. Pull over,
SPECTRE Green. Get out of the way!

812
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,151
Give them a warning shot.

813
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,836
Rifle grenade, fire.

814
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,310
<i>Forward machine gun, fire.</i>

815
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,757
<i>You're firing too close.</i>

816
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,674
<i>SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,</i>
<i>you're firing too close.</i>

817
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:02,232
<i>You're trying to stop them,</i>
<i>not to sink them.</i>

818
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,229
Here, take the wheel.

819
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,955
Slow down.

820
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,119
Slow down. Slow down all boats.

821
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,759
Green, go alongside
while we keep you covered.

822
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,239
Hands up, Mr Bond.

823
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:45,279
- Without the drums we can go faster.
- Hand me the Very pistol.

824
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,956
<i>Keep your hands up. We're sending</i>
<i>a boat along to take you off.</i>

825
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,789
There's a saying in England,
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."

826
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:13,672
Green, change your course.
Go astern.

827
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,352
All boats, throw out your ammunition.
Get rid of it, quick.

828
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,436
Get rid of it.

829
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,319
Jump.

830
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,471
<i>(phone)</i>

831
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,435
Don't go away.

832
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,073
Yes.

833
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,233
Oh, thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?
And send up a porter for the luggage.

834
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:06,278
<i>Avanti.</i>

835
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,669
<i>- Permesso, signore?</i>
<i>- Sì, prego.</i>

836
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,038
And also get me the British Consul.
Thank you.

837
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,831
<i>(phone)</i>

838
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,511
Yes? Oh, Mr Maxwell, please.
James Bond.

839
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,194
James, we will miss the plane.
And we will...

840
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:48,876
Hello, Paul? Bond here.
I wanted to thank you for everything.

841
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,590
Signal the office we're on our way back,
will you? What was that?

842
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,671
Here, leave that. I'll take it.

843
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,390
What? Oh, no.
Should be routine from here on in.

844
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:05,668
<i>- Hello, what was that you were saying?</i>
- Klebb.

845
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,354
<i>James, you still there? Hello?</i>

846
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,598
Romanova, the door.

847
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,191
Romanova!

848
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,675
Take this.

849
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,877
Horrible woman.

850
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,872
Yes. She's had her kicks.

851
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:02,674
# <i>From Russia with love</i>

852
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,071
# <i>I'd fly to you...</i>

853
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,674
Here you are.
In case you ever need it again.

854
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:12,070
Oh, yes. All government property
has to be accounted for.

855
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,948
But as I said before, we won't always
work on the company's time, will we?

856
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,314
No.

857
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,158
# <i>I've travelled the world...</i>

858
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,550
James, behave yourself.
We are being filmed.

859
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,190
Oh, not again.

860
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,033
# <i>... return</i>

861
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,873
# <i>From Russia with love</i>

862
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,076
He was right, you know.

863
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,799
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

864
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,633
# <i>... faces</i>

865
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,555
# <i>And smile for a moment</i>

866
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,319
# <i>But, oh</i>

867
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,957
# <i>You haunted me so</i>

868
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:02,399
# <i>Still my tongue-tied</i>

869
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:09,314
# <i>Young pride would not let my love</i>

870
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:13,279
# <i>For you show</i>

871
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:18,715
# <i>In case you'd say no</i>

872
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:26,917
# <i>To Russia I flew</i>

873
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,879
# <i>But there and then</i>

874
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,878
# <i>I suddenly knew</i>

875
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,556
# <i>You'd care again</i>

876
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,236
# <i>My running around</i>

877
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,352
# <i>Is proof</i>

878
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:56,188
# <i>I'd fly to you</i>

879
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:59,158
# <i>From Russia</i>

880
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:09,673
